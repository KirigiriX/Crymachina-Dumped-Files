  "1312020004": "I mean, the alternative is gettin' killed by the Cherubim.",
  "1312020011": "Outstanding work out there, Leben.\nIt's no wonder you're the Chosen One.",
  "1312030005": "I guess that's as good a reason as any...",
  "1312080002": "Yes. They are E.V.E., although their Synthetic Frames\nare slightly different versions.",
  "1312010004": "Yes. Though unfortunately, that won't be enough on its own.",
  "1313050042": "Yes. It's much more likely that Eden will be destroyed.",
  "1312020038": "Yes... That's how it is.",
  "1312020025": "Yes, that's how it is.",
  "1312050013": "If only everybody thought like that...",
  "1312020006": "I've been wondering, though. Are there are\nany Dei ex Machina you've already beaten?",
  "1313000007": "Come to think of it, didn't we find Letheia's research\ndata at the checkpoint?",
  "1310010011": "What about you?\nDid you feel confused when you first came to?",
  "1313010011": "You can bet I will.",
  "1313000006": "So do I.",
  "1312000013": "Yes, a very good thing. Whenever you find code,\nmake sure to bring it to me.",
  "1313050026": "YES! EXTINCT! NO LONGER CAN MAN\nBE RESTORED IN EDEN! DOOM! FEAR!",
  "1312050012": "Humans, however, have to be kind.\nOtherwise, they forfeit their right to live.",
  "1310000019": "Anyway, I'm Mikoto Sengiku. Good to meet you.",
  "1310000059": "At any rate...",
  "1310000052": "And my jurisdiction is psyche reconstruction.",
  "1310010070": "I see...",
  "1310000044": "And the white monster and giant whale thing we\nsaw back there are two of those Dei ex Machina?",
  "1310000097": "You'll come to understand eventually.\nI was a lot like you myself at first.",
  "1310000078": "For this, we need a Real Human recognized by Eden's\nsystem.",
  "1310010072": "I'll be waiting for you at the Data Transport Terminal\nwhenever you're ready.",
  "1310000068": "As a result...",
  "1310000073": "Consequently, the Dei ex Machina who were unwilling\nto recognize you three as humans launched an assault.",
  "1312080018": "Exactly.",
  "1310000045": "Exactly. Good girl. You're so quick to understand.",
  "1310000004": "Quite right. I wasn't so much anxious as concerned\nyou might do something reckless.",
  "1310000040": "That ship is Eden.",
  "1312080012": "But now you're fightin' each other?\nJust who's supposed to be broken, again?",
  "1312040000": "Alright. Be back soon.",
  "1311030005": "In any case, I'll take over from here.",
  "1310020012": "Good. Then I'll send you the details on how to operate\nthe Data Transport Terminal.",
  "1311000037": "Well then, Leben.",
  "1310000053": "As we each have different functions to suit our duties,\nour designs vary accordingly.",
  "1311000034": "But how should I secure that \"gateway\" thing, exactly?",
  "1313010008": "Or is it not even deep, and they're just THAT stupid?",
  "1312000010": "Also, Leben, come talk to me when you have\na chance. I'll analyze that code from earlier.",
  "1311000014": "And it's best to hedge against risks.\nI can't endanger all of the E.V.E. at once.",
  "1310010039": "I mean, no, but...",
  "1312020034": "I would. You're a very good girl, Leben.",
  "1310010017": "Why do you want to become a Real Human anyway?",
  "1312030012": "She doesn't want to expose you to real danger,\nknowing that. Isn't that right, Mikoto?",
  "1312020032": "Nobody's ever asked me that.\nThank you, Leben. You're so sweet.",
  "1313020008": "Yes. Should Letheia be willing to cooperate,\nwe won't have to resort to force.",
  "1310000000": "We made it.",
  "1312030021": "Yes, but be cautious accessing undeveloped addresses.\nThey can be very dangerous.",
  "1311000020": "So make sure you don't die.\nIf you do, that's the end.",
  "1311020004": "As such, they typically have stronger security.",
  "1310000092": "That's why I kept searching and searching until\nI finally found your data.",
  "1310000104": "But if a noble cause like humanity doesn't cut it,\nthen you might as well find your own goal to work\ntoward.",
  "1313050020": "That is why space is quiet. Because only the quiet\ncivilizations survive. Apparently, Letheia did some\nrather bleak and gloomy reading.",
  "1310000057": "That's why our clothes are back to the way they used\nto be.",
  "1312050011": "Survival of the fittest is just nature's way.\nYou've gotta be strong to keep on kickin'.",
  "1310010067": "Then...if it means getting to be with Enoa...\nI guess I don't mind joining the family.",
  "1310010025": "Am I right?!",
  "1310000056": "Incidentally, this Imitation Garden is also a miniature\nvirtual world.",
  "1310000046": "And just FYI, Enoa's a Deus ex Machina too.",
  "1310010044": "By the way, Leben.\nYou're a part of this family, too, from now on.",
  "1312080030": "A moment, if you would.",
  "1310000064": "I...think I'm starting to get it.",
  "1310020011": "I think I get the picture...more or less.",
  "1311000016": "Just a little.",
  "1310000020": "Aaand that about does it for introductions.\nYou're all caught up now.",
  "1312010016": "So in a way, this is our retaliation.",
  "1310000081": "In other words, a human can stop the machines. But that\nalso means none of us are actually recognized as one yet.",
  "1311000026": "So, what kind of risks are we talking?",
  "1313020011": "I don't want to hurt them, if I can help it.",
  "1312010009": "That's why we need to collect not only ExP, but\nIdea Code from other Dei ex Machina as well.",
  "1310000049": "But you look human--not at all like those other two.",
  "1312020018": "A lot happened, suffice it to say.",
  "1313050041": "But didn't you just say it's dangerous to stand out in space?",
  "1313050021": "But we considered that possibility from the beginning\nand took steps to counteract it.",
  "1311020013": "But I know you'll be just fine, Leben.",
  "1313010031": "Maybe first contact already happened, but it was covered up.",
  "1313020005": "Still, there has to be a way to settle this with words\ninstead of violence.",
  "1312020036": "But it's alright. We are machines.\nWe don't feel such emotions as pain.",
  "1311000030": "But I'm going to have to fight them?",
  "1313020027": "Whatever you say...\nAnyway, we'll try to talk it out instead of goin' in swinging.",
  "1310000067": "Back on topic; after giving it my all, I finally achieved\nmy goal of reconstructing the human psyche.",
  "1310010030": "What do you mean?",
  "1310000087": "But why me? How did I get involved?",
  "1310010000": "How're you doin'? Sort everything out yet?",
  "1310010068": "Well?\nHave you found a reason to become a Real Human?",
  "1313010033": "I can't say. It's not recorded in our database.",
  "1310020007": "Is that some sort of magic spell?",
  "1313010001": "Something on your mind?",
  "1313010005": "What is?",
  "1310010050": "Then what's your beef?",
  "1313050048": "You don't need to apologize, Mikoto.",
  "1313060005": "What?",
  "1312050005": "Then we'll have to teach you all the\nwonders of familial love ourselves.",
  "1310010071": "If that's the case, why don't you try experiencing our\nmission firsthand?",
  "1310010010": "This drowsiness had better shake itself off soon, then.",
  "1310010007": "So you have a fetish for robots.",
  "1310010060": "What, you got a problem with Enoa being included?",
  "1313010027": "The what?",
  "1311000029": "Sounds doable, right?",
  "1311000008": "Either way, we all want the same thing.",
  "1310000009": "Hey.",
  "1312080004": "Excuse me.",
  "1312060008": "*sigh*",
  "1312090008": "Yeah, yeah. Clean it all you want.\nA polished turd is still a turd.",
  "1311000007": "I'd say this is more akin to sending a child off\non an errand for the very first time.",
  "1310000012": "I'm Ami Shido. It's lovely to meet you.\nAre you still in high school, Leben?",
  "1312080023": "Pfft. You get that line from the lackey handbook?\nI can't believe you think numbers alone will net\nyou the win.",
  "1312020002": "Haha, it sure can be.",
  "1310000099": "How mean.",
  "1310000008": "Good girls. You always get along so well.",
  "1312090012": "Heh, all in a day's work. What'd ya think, Leben?\nYou gain some newfound respect for me?",
  "1312030006": "My, how kind of you.",
  "1310000007": "Heehee.",
  "1312030017": "A gold star for each of you.",
  "1310010048": "Heh heh. There's no need to be shy.",
  "1312030014": "Aw, look at you, all red in the face.\nDon't forget, I understand you best.",
  "1312080029": "Hmph.",
  "1313060002": "Hmph. The future is what you make of it.",
  "1313010034": "Hmm... Then maybe there are no aliens.\nWe're alone in this universe after all.",
  "1313010030": "Huh.",
  "1313020010": "After all, I'm sure the other Dei ex Machina are like\nsiblings to you.",
  "1313000011": "Guess we'll just have to get to know him ourselves.",
  "1310000031": "To start...",
  "1313010013": "Doubt it.\nMost E.V.E. Personality Data's been totally wiped.",
  "1310010012": "Nope. Not one bit. I'm pretty adaptable, and bein'\na film buff means I'm used to ridiculous storylines.",
  "1310010069": "Not even close.\nI'm still not sure all of this is real in the first place.",
  "1310000098": "I couldn't process any of it. I thought I was being\npranked for some mediocre television program.",
  "1312010005": "As a faulty Deus ex Machina, there's a limit on\nhow much ExP I can allocate to each of you.",
  "1311000017": "Personality Data is quite delicate and complex.\nIt's unique to each of you and can't be backed up.",
  "1312080008": "As your creator, I am the one who can give your hearts\nthe care they deserve.",
  "1313020017": "You're all so kind.",
  "1312000002": "Everything worked out in the end.\nDon't think twice about it.",
  "1311000018": "So if your Synthetic Frame were to be damaged,\nand your Personality Data along with it...",
  "1313000009": "If you'd like, you can give it a look in the archive.",
  "1312050001": "Of course. We're family.",
  "1310000028": "You want worse?",
  "1313050018": "It goes beyond that.\nWhat Letheia observed is the answer to Fermi's Paradox.",
  "1313010007": "Were they originally a trio? Or does it only look\nlike there's four when there's actually three?",
  "1310000038": "I knew it. Humans are stupid.",
  "1312000012": "I don't really get it, but it sounds like a good thing.",
  "1312080038": "Bring it on.\nI'll beat you with pomp AND circumstance.",
  "1311000036": "Got it.",
  "1312000009": "For sure.",
  "1310000066": "...And now I'm lost again.",
  "1313010014": "Apparently, what little is left was diverted to\nreinforce the Cherubim and other systems.",
  "1310000074": "I was able to evacuate my data, as well as\nMikoto's and Ami's, to the Imitation Garden...",

  "1321010036": "For over a thousand years in cosmic time, I rolled the\ndice over and over, until finally, all of you were born.",
  "1321000001": "So next up is the domain's checkpoint and central core?",
  "1320020001": "Now I can allocate more ExP to you all.\nThat will bring you closer to being Real Humans.",
  "1321050000": "I can't do this anymore.",
  "1320030020": "I'm sorry, Yuri. For being such a stupid, heartless sister.\nFor forgetting you.",
  "1320075000": "Here we are. Logos' domain.\nThose space whales sure look familiar.",
  "1320075012": "If I ever have to fight those space whales, I'll\ntry to kill 'em as painlessly as possible for you.",
  "1320060008": "So this Logos is like a nemesis to you guys?",
  "1320050011": "What about hobbies or things that you enjoy?",
  "1321000002": "Yes. You're starting to get the hang of it. Good girl.",
  "1322010015": "Now that you bring it up...\nDid you use to fight out there too, Ami?",
  "1320075007": "Oh, you did mention that you like whales,\ndidn't you, Leben?",
  "1320075022": "Oh, you did mention that you like whales,\ndidn't you, Leben?",
  "1322060016": "You're right, Mikoto. It all turned out fine.\nGold stars for everyone.",
  "1322020001": "And at the far end of it is the kingpin of all these jackass\nwhales.",
  "1321040021": "I see.",
  "1320060003": "I'm guessin' the Deus ex Machina in charge\nof that network's gonna be our new target?",
  "1322010023": "Please stop calling me that.\nIt gets more embarrassing every time...",
  "1320050021": "And it's exhausting to have people hate you,\nnot to mention hating them back.",
  "1321010008": "I mean... Yeah... I guess.",
  "1322020006": "It was a living hell...",
  "1321010006": "That's because she's a machine and not an annoying\nhuman like you.",
  "1322050035": "It can't be...",
  "1321020009": "Oh, no.\nIt's nothing compared to the structures mankind made.",
  "1320050006": "Hardly. I'm not kind. l even managed to forget about my\n\"beloved\" little sister.",
  "1321040017": "If it's slumber you're after,\nI can bring you greater happiness.",
  "1320000002": "I made it.",
  "1322010010": "That's why I called her a piece of work.\nI'm too cool to be pitied.",
  "1320060001": "As such, securing that gateway will be our next priority.",
  "1321000011": "But now that you've got something to strive for,\nyou'll be fine, right?",
  "1321010005": "Hey, you're the one bending over backwards for her.\nIt's like you see her in a different light compared to\neveryone else.",
  "1322010033": "Defining humanity is Anthropos' role.\nEven if Noein is the interim overseer,\nshe's infringing upon his jurisdiction.",
  "1321040004": "No. I mean that I don't know anything.\nI know only that I know nothing.",
  "1322010039": "Not quite. Noein's role is confidential, kept secret even\nfrom us. That's why I can't answer you.",
  "1320040003": "Just got a little dizzy, is all... I had a flashback\nof something from before I became an E.V.E.",
  "1322050007": "Which means...?",
  "1322050000": "That's one huge whale...",
  "1320075028": "Keep in mind, that courage will help 'em pick a\nfight with you. And believe me, they'll stick it out.",
  "1320030014": "And yet it happened anyway.",
  "1322010031": "It is for these reasons that some of the other\nDei ex Machina attempted to sabotage my domain.",
  "1321010007": "But you wouldn't get this way with just any old machine,\nright?",
  "1320050034": "Still...",
  "1322050018": "But still...! Attacking might provoke it into a fight!",
  "1321050003": "You hear that? Now's your chance to run.",
  "1321050008": "Another gold star for you.",
  "1322050034": "There's no room to escape.\nThis is the only sensible method.",
  "1320075017": "Just who are they?",
  "1320080008": "How do you figure?",
  "1321050001": "Should I finish her?",
  "1322010026": "None of them are even credible in the first place.",
  "1321040009": "Both are a mystery to me.",
  "1320050022": "It's a good thing we're family, then.\nThe love and devotion of family is never-changing.",
  "1320075013": "Try not to kill them at all.",
  "1321010037": "That's...pretty overwhelming.",
  "1321010027": "Hey, Enoa. How exactly did you manage to reproduce\nthe personalities of dead people as data?",
  "1322010004": "Oh yeah?",
  "1321040007": "Huh?",
  "1320080001": "Huh? Imaginary?",
  "1321010013": "Yeah, Yuri's dad.",
  "1321010020": "Yeah. I've always wanted to say, I'm impressed at how\nfluent you two are in my language.",
  "1321040012": "Excuse me?",
  "1321010026": "I guess she deserves a gold star of her own.",
  "1320040006": "It won't hurt them, will it?",
  "1321010021": "That's very kind of you.\nBut actually, we hear your speech in Japanese.",
  "1321040003": "You'd rather talk with this, you mean.\nYou're more violent than you look.",
  "1320040011": "Wait. You had one too, Mikoto?",
  "1321010017": "Oh yeah? You and Mikoto are both Japanese, right?",
  "1321010009": "See?",
  "1321010029": "Then again, even if you try to explain,\nit probably won't make much of a difference.",
  "1322050002": "It would be more accurate to say the reverse,\nfor Logos' kin are created in its image.",
  "1322050010": "Don't worry. I'll free you soon, okay?",
  "1320040025": "If I want, is it possible to resurrect my sister?",
  "1321000005": "Of course. Lettin' the rookie get their feet wet is what\nbeing a mentor's all about. And more importantly...",
  "1320040007": "The fluctuations were momentary, and data homeostasis\nhas been restored. Their humanity simply increased.",
  "1322020012": "I know.",
  "1320060012": "The raid on us was ordered by Zoe, the Seventh,\nwho has secured Logos and governs its actions.",
  "1322060011": "A part of my Idea Code, yes.",
  "1320040021": "But I was the last Dei ex Machina to be manufactured,\nmaking me the \"youngest,\" so to speak.",
  "1320050033": "I'm a machine.\nSuch physiological responses don't occur with me.",
  "1321010038": "I'm a machine, so it was no problem.",
  "1320050030": "Me?",
  "1322010017": "It's kind of tough to imagine you in combat.",
  "1321010015": "What about you? What's your sister's name?",
  "1320050013": "So you like people, then.",
  "1322020008": "Doesn't sound like it shook you up too bad.",
  "1321010042": "Anthropos?",
  "1322050032": "We can still retrieve the Idea Code.\nAs long as we fulfill our goal, that's worth a gold star.",
  "1320040027": "It's just a selfish desire, though.\nI don't know if that's okay...",
  "1322060009": "It crashed into Eden's outer wall.",
  "1321020003": "Either to Eden's outer developments or\nto areas that are damaged and in need of\nrepairs. Their primary role is construction.",
  "1321020010": "Eden was drafted by machinery--a blueprint with no soul.\nHuman designs are much more appealing and far more\ndistinguished.",
  "1320075001": "Hey, Enoa. We allowed to harpoon 'em?",
  "1321010023": "Enoa's been interpreting all the words she recognizes,\nwhether in Eden or here in the Imitation Garden.",
  "1320080006": "I'm here to get Enoa's Idea Code back.",
  "1322050036": "I don't want to hurt your siblings if I don't have to...",
  "1322010024": "Hey, Enoa. Have you checked that message from the\nThird Deus ex Machina yet?",
  "1320080004": "Alright. I get what you're tryna say.\nLet's you and me keep this civilized, then.",
  "1321010004": "Are you done?",
  "1320075009": "\"Courageous\" doesn't normally come to mind...",
  "1320075024": "\"Courageous\" doesn't normally come to mind...",
  "1320080011": "What a stupid, prejudiced philosophy.\nStill, that makes things easier for me.",
  "1322060003": "Even with the cables cut, it's still kicking.\nDoes that mean it's in the clear?",
  "1322050031": "If you break the cables, you can free Logos,\nno matter how severe its wounds become...",
  "1320090001": "I've modified the gateway permissions. Now you'll be\nable to access other addresses in the Vast Arsenal NET.",
  "1321000000": "Good job on securing the gateway.\nAnother gold star for you.",
  "1321010031": "Dice?",
  "1321020007": "The Sagrada Família was almost complete,\nso the Kowloon Walled City may be a more\napt comparison.",
  "1320040008": "According to the system,\nthey're both very human and healthy.",
  "1321040008": "I don't know why Lady Zoe assigned me here.\nAnd I don't know why she doesn't want you to\nmeet Logos.",
  "1320075002": "No. I would like you to disregard all except for the\nmost hostile.",
  "1320050003": "She was a skilled piano player...\nA fashionista who liked following the latest trends.",
  "1321040020": "I want to experience real sleep in a real body.\nThat is why I follow Lady Zoe, the Seventh.",
  "1321040006": "I don't know. I really don't.",
  "1322010005": "She was into real niche independent works.\nI asked her why, and she said it was because\nshe \"felt bad for them in an affectionate way.\"",
  "1320020000": "Thank you, Mikoto.",
  "1321000003": "Hey, Mikoto.",
  "1322010000": "What was your sister like, Mikoto?",
  "1322010009": "Sounds like she felt bad for you in an affectionate way, too.",
  "1321010018": "Mikoto's whole family is, yes,\nbut I have some French in my blood.",
  "1320040018": "That's a unique analysis.",
  "1321010012": "Yuri... As in the flower?\nIs one of your parents Japanese?",
  "1321010011": "It's Yuri.",
  "1320030007": "What about your dad?",
  "1320030018": "Yuri did wind up alone. I couldn't even be there\nin her last moments. I let my poor little sister die...\nall by herself...",
  "1320030025": "Don't leave me on my own.\nYou're the one thing that keeps me going.",
  "1321010016": "Rin. And Mikoto's sister was Yoru.",
  "1320060000": "Letheia's data contained an address for a gateway leading\nto another network.",
  "1321000004": "You handled things for me back in Letheia's domain,\nso can I go this time?",
  "1320050028": "Are you feeling better now, Leben?",
  "1321050007": "Well done, Leben.\nNow we can reach the central core.",
  "1322050030": "Attack the cables, Leben.\nIt's time to push back.",
  "1322050026": "It now considers Leben an enemy.",
  "1320040015": "So Leben is also the older of two sisters.\nThat makes three of us.",
  "1320050015": "And you, Leben? What are you partial to?",
  "1321010010": "What's your sister's name, Leben?",
  "1320050000": "What was your sister like, Leben?",
  "1320075011": "Well, eye of the beholder, and all that.",
  "1320040030": "You're the Chosen One, Leben.\nI know you can become human.",
  "1320050019": "You're always saying that,\nbut what exactly do you dislike about people?",
  "1321010019": "You're of German descent, I presume?",
  "1320050007": "You ARE kind, Leben.\nEven if you can be a little difficult sometimes.",
  "1321010000": "You've got a real thing for little sisters, huh?",
  "1322050028": "Logos' Idea Code is primitive, Leben.\nDialogue is no longer possible. Stand ready.",
  "1320075004": "Logos' kin. They're good, obedient children who\nmaintain the infrastructure of Eden and develop\nits facilities.",
  "1320075018": "Logos' kin. They're good, obedient children who\nmaintain the infrastructure of Eden and develop\nits facilities.",
  "1322000003": "Zoe must be keeping Logos restrained somehow.\nAll we need to do is destroy whatever's binding it.",
  "1320060013": "If we can free Logos from Zoe's control, it should\ncomply with our wishes, neutralizing it as a threat.",
  "1320060010": "It is the most machine-like of Dei ex Machina, akin to a tool.",
  "1320050012": "Mine include portrait photography, camping, collecting\npicture books--and, of course, you, Mikoto, and Enoa.",
  "1320050014": "What I like is family.",
  "1321050004": "Vida. I have a message for Zoe.\nTell her I want to talk.",
  "1320040032": "That's a relief.",
  "1321000012": "Once you make up your mind,\nall that remains is to follow through.",
  "1322060002": "It's leaving in quite a hurry.",
  "1321040000": "I won't let you reach the central core,\nlet alone the Sixth Deus ex Machina.",
  "1320060011": "So long as it doesn't conflict with the principles\nof its prime directive, it will do whatever it's told.",
  "1320060002": "Sounds good.",
  "1320050002": "The only thing you have right about me is hating humans.\nBut my sister and I have nothing in common.",
  "1320030023": "Make sure you keep your word this time.",
  "1322020003": "What can I do.",
  "1322010036": "If she's only a substitute, then what was Noein's original role?",
  "1321040019": "That would only be a dream within a dream.\nSleep should be a physical sensation in the\nphysical world.",
  "1321010028": "You mentioned something about \"virtual recreations\"\nbefore, but I can't really get a handle on it.",
  "1321040018": "You can doze away even longer in a virtual world--where\nyour perception of time can be manipulated--than in reality.",
  "1320075008": "Aren't they just so adorably courageous?",
  "1320075023": "Aren't they just so adorably courageous?",
  "1320050004": "A good, kind girl. One who always put family first.",
  "1321010025": "She's both cute AND talented.\nNot a day goes by where I don't appreciate her.",
  "1320040022": "Even so, love--whether fraternal or sororal--is beautiful.\nIt's one of the many wonderful feelings your species has.",
  "1322050006": "I'm still mid-analysis, but it would likely be risky to do so,\nseeing as they are connected directly to Logos' heart.",
  "1320040026": "It is, if you become a Real Human.",
  "1321010002": "It all makes sense now.\nEnoa does give off a younger vibe.",
  "1320075020": "No. You should disregard all except for the most hostile.",
  "1320060014": "So there's a chance we can get it on our side?",
  "1320030017": "Liar.",
  "1321010032": "I simulated 100 million years of Earth's history\n500 novemdecillion times per second.",
  "1321010033": "More specifically, by placing artificial life with randomized\nvalues into a virtual replication of Earth's environment and\nallowing it to evolve.",
  "1320040016": "Kind of a random thing to have in common.",
  "1320050025": "If it does change, that only means it wasn't genuine.",
  "1320050026": "Does lasting love like that actually exist?",
  "1321020000": "Wow... It's like I'm inside a giant aquarium.\nAnd look how many whales there are.",
  "1320030013": "Don't worry. Your dad is doing his best to make\nsure that doesn't happen.",
  "1322020000": "Here we are.\nThe central core of the Vast Arsenal NET.",
  "1321030000": "The checkpoint of the Vast Arsenal NET\nwill be at this area's terminus.",
  "1320040017": "Maybe having a younger sister helps to develop\none's humanity?",
  "1320050008": "Aiming to be a Real Human so you can revive your\nsister is enough to show how much you care about\nyour family.",
  "1321000006": "You wanna bring back your sister, yeah?",
  "1321010003": "So since you're into that sorta stuff, some part\nof her triggered your protective sisterly instincts.",
  "1322050038": "You are a part of my beloved family.\nThat's why I want you to come back alive.",
  "1321040013": "I was asleep. Because I was tired.",
  "1320040023": "I want you to cherish it.\nYou should celebrate the things that make you human.",
  "1320050005": "Well, those last two apply to you, if nothing else.",
  "1320050010": "I doubt it. As far as personality goes,\nthe three of us couldn't be more different.",
  "1321010045": "A rare ally, in other words. Though no doubt\nhe's been attacked as well. I hope he's safe...",
  "1320030005": "Are you here to haunt me or something?\nOr did they bring you back as an E.V.E. like me?",
  "1321040023": "Or you could turn back.\nThat way, I can nod off a little longer.",
  "1322010008": "She was pretty, uh, avant-garde. But maybe that's why she\nwas the only one in the family who gave a damn about me.",
  "1322020011": "If things come to blows, don't hesitate.\nYou've got a sister to bring back.",
  "1322010012": "\"Clash\"? We're supposed to be freeing it, remember?",
  "1322010014": "Battles upon battles are all we've ever known.",
  "1320075014": "Hey, if I didn't have to fight, I wouldn't.\nThe more lives I can spare, the better.",
  "1320075015": "But if I don't bring the pain, I won't survive.\nWe gotta be ready to kill and be killed.",
  "1320080002": "You were birthed in a hollow world inconducive to the\nadvancement of civilization.",
  "1320060005": "It presides over civilization development in a technoscientific\ncapacity, overseeing Eden's infrastructure and establishing\nfacilities.",
  "1320080010": "Uncivilized technology. A Deus ex Machina that touts\nan empty void. Neither has any place in Eden.",
  "1320060015": "It's highly capable, so that would be the most\nhelpful outcome.",
  "1321020006": "So it's the future's version of the Sagrada Família.",
  "1320075026": "I can't say for real whales, but Logos' kin\ncan certainly be described as courageous.",
  "1321010035": "Then again until a human behavior arose as a sample point,\nand again until a being's humanity was recognized by Eden.",
  "1321010034": "I did this repeatedly until a historical event occurred as\na sample point. And then again until a person emerged\nas a sample point.",

  "1331010035": "Same. My memories of Yuri are getting more\nand more vivid.",
  "1330050002": "Same. Memories of my sister.",
  "1330050022": "Zoe is also known to do and say some inexplicable\nthings unbefitting a machine. I never know how to\ninteract with her.",

  "1332100030": "Ahahahaha! Sooo lame.\nWhat a bunch of embarrassing losers.",
  "1331010019": "Oh...? That's all well and good, but being\nat Mikoto's side is a right reserved for me.\nI won't be giving it up.",
  "1331010013": "Aww.",
  "1332080014": "It can't be.",
  "1330050024": "That would be impossible.",
  "1330100016": "My thanks. I have high hopes for you.",
  "1332030008": "I won't.",
  "1330070003": "Those Cherubim are still in production. They were\ntest models for your Synthetic Frames, you know.",
  "1330090042": "In fact, the reason we've been meeting with\nyou guys one-on-one is because Lady Zoe--",
  "1332010015": "It's okay. Leave everything to me and get some rest.",
  "1330030029": "It's fine.\nYou wouldn't be yourself if you were okay without me.",
  "1330000015": "Cut it out already.",
  "1330050017": "It's nothing to be sorry about.\nAre your symptoms better now?",
  "1330090026": "That's a pretty extreme conclusion.",
  "1330030021": "Why don't I just bring your keyboard to the hospital?",
  "1331030003": "Be back...soon.",
  "1330080000": "Take care, Mikoto.",

  "1332040001": "Take care out there.",
  "1332020036": "So it might still be worth a shot.",
  "1331050007": "Then I hope she collects more ExP, stat.\nThat girl needs all the humanity she can get.",
  "1331010002": "Why would we even need makeup in these bodies?",
  "1331000015": "It's not that. I just want to fight Zoe myself.",
  "1330100004": "No. I'd rather you not turn to your last resort.",
  "1330090033": "You'd know what I mean if you had to fight for\nyour life against a handful of hordes hunting\nyou down.",
  "1332030017": "No. Now's our chance. Let's take advantage\nof the chaos and advance to the central core.",
  "1332100002": "Oh, stop.",
  "1331010001": "Wow, you could tell I changed my makeup?",
  "1332020031": "What?",
  "1330100002": "Zoe's belief that the physical body stands\nabove all is likely the main culprit to blame.",
  "1330000002": "Welcome back, Leben.",
  "1330000001": "Welcome back.",
  "1330050011": "I feel a lot better, thanks to you.",
  "1332080007": "Don't be ridiculous.\nWe have no reason to flee from Anthropos.",
  "1331010014": "The two of you have such opposite personalities,\nit's surprising that you manage to get along so well.",
  "1330000003": "Good work.",
  "1332000003": "The bird in the basket...\nWhen, oh when will it come out?",
  "1332000002": "Kagome, kagome...",
  "1330070001": "This is the Life Station. It's where research and\ndevelopment for human somatic reconstruction\nis held.",
  "1332020011": "I'm the one who should be sorry.",
  "1330050020": "Do you have something against the Seventh\nDeus ex Machina? It sounded that way when\nyou were talking about her.",
  "1331050008": "That just leaves the central core.",
  "1330030016": "Forget about my meals already.",
  "1330030008": "Sorry. It was hard to get permission to visit.",
  "1332100008": "Then what is she!?",
  "1331040017": "If you keep it short.",
  "1332030006": "I'm feeling okay. No need to worry about me.",
  "1330060002": "Yes. Now I can finally get back at her for the raid.\nFeel free to go on a rampage, Mikoto.",
  "1332100017": "Precisely. Such is the intent of the E.V.E Project.",
  "1332080005": "That's good news for us.",
  "1330090050": "Yeah? Well, I like the way you riff\noff my one-liners, so tell you what;\nI'll save killing you as my last resort.",
  "1332020037": "Exactly.",
  "1330050007": "Is that right?",
  "1330030010": "Yeah, but the scientific article that originally made that\nclaim got rejected by peer review.",
  "1330070006": "Now that that you mention it,\nI don't think I've ever seen any female Cherubim.",
  "1330050027": "Setting that aside, then, what's Zoe in charge of?",
  "1332030012": "Oh, right. I remember Hayim saying Anthropos attacked\nNoein the Third.",
  "1330050005": "Was I?",
  "1332020015": "Right... There's nothing to expect from me anyway.\nMy whole stupid life is pointless...",
  "1331040030": "Okay. That's nice. Then let's fight.",
  "1330040020": "You're right. Unlike me, Leben is the Chosen One...",
  "1332020009": "Have I?",
  "1330100011": "Really. I don't get the sense that she even listened\nto the message we sent with Vida the other day.",
  "1331010038": "Did I? I forget. It's been a while.",
  "1332070024": "Rotten E.V.E.\nAre you the one they call Leben?",
  "1331010020": "I never said I wanted it.",
  "1332070033": "And if I simply analyze your data afterward...",
  "1332100014": "She is also the one who forced the E.V.E. Project\ninto motion and caused the First Deus ex Machina,\nwho opposed her, to become lost.",
  "1330090006": "You ought to surrender the gateway for YOUR own sake.\nIf you do, I'll make sure it doesn't hurt when I kill you.",
  "1331010029": "To conform with this rule, a rebellion suppression\nmechanism was installed onto every machine in\nEden.",
  "1331010030": "Said mechanism causes damage to a machine\nif it attempts to attack something that has a high\nlevel of humanity.",
  "1330090020": "I'd like to keep it peaceful too, actually.",
  "1331010033": "That term isn't quite correct.\nTo us, humans are akin to gods.",
  "1332020020": "Besides, it isn't for a fact that you can never do so.",
  "1330090047": "That's a shame.",
  "1332100022": "That is the E.V.E. Project--naught else but a means\nthrough which Lilly seeks to revive her sister.",
  "1330000020": "If you don't like that, then don't fight anymore.\nOtherwise, you'll just lose your nerve and die.",
  "1332020025": "One more thing, Leben. You are my cherished E.V.E.\nA human worthy of love. Even if Eden doesn't approve\nof you, I always will.",
  "1330000023": "I know, I know.\nShe's only trying to be considerate.",
  "1330030017": "What I want is to hear you play piano again.",
  "1332040006": "Yeah, weird. I figured they would be,\nseeing as they're Zoe's personal guard.",
  "1330000013": "So there’s no need to fret.",
  "1330090046": "So no. I won't join you.\nI'll be taking the gateway instead.",
  "1332070013": "Rather, it is the E.V.E. Project that is defective.",
  "1330090048": "I'll admit, though--I respect your loyalty. You came\noff as a homicidal maniac at first, but I like you.",
  "1330040011": "But to be on the safe side,\nLeben should sit out for a while.",
  "1331040033": "Then how can you act so indifferent!?\nAre you saying me pouring my heart\nout didn't make you feel anything!?",
  "1332020006": "Then we have to support each other.\nOtherwise, it's just a word.",
  "1332070031": "So what if there aren't?",
  "1330100005": "What about you, Enoa?\nGot anything you want to tell her?",
  "1331040008": "You misunderstand. I haven't even been able\nto get in contact with Anthropos for some time.",
  "1330040013": "Think of it as an allergic reaction of sorts.\nIt can happen sometimes when you acquire ExP.",
  "1331040027": "contact with them, I eventually grew aware of my original\nself. Of the truth behind this world. You see, I am actually\na vampire's--",
  "1331040020": "the class would ever see the culprit. I couldn't say a thing\nto my mom or dad about what was going on. The only\nperson I could turn to was my best friend, Yuuri. She'd",
  "1330090017": "Right?",
  "1332070004": "But that body...",
  "1330070009": "Then why haven't we seen a single one?\nThere must've been data for SOME guys\nin the virtual world.",
  "1331010016": "But the more she came to my aid,\nthe more she began to grow on me.",
  "1330090019": "Hey, Enoa. You say keep it peaceful, but how am I\nsupposed to do that when this punk keeps pushing\nmy buttons?",
  "1331000006": "That aside, do you think Zoe will really come to the\ncheckpoint, Enoa?",
  "1330090031": "There's no way we're from the same era,\nlet alone generation.",
  "1330090044": "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "1332030001": "What's the matter?",
  "1332020001": "Where's this coming from?",
  "1330070011": "Why's that?",
  "1330090041": "What? Don't you trust me? Lady Zoe is an honorable\nDeus ex Machina. She'll listen as long as you're sensible.",
  "1331010004": "...something about you feels off.\nThough I can't really put my finger on it...",
  "1330000019": "Surviving at the expense of another isn't barbaric.\nIt's the way nature works.",
  "1330040014": "Your condition should improve a bit if you\ndistract yourself with some music or reading.",
  "1331010009": "What is?",
  "1331020004": "Presumably, she would be much deeper within.",
  "1330090032": "Then I guess it's our current lives that set us apart.",
  "1330090012": "What do you mean, you'll \"do your best\"!?",
  "1331010032": "I see. So humans are a machine's natural predator.",
  "1331030004": "...I'm not sure why, but hearing Mikoto's\nvoice has been giving me the chills lately.",
  "1330050010": "See? No different from me.",
  "1332100006": "Huh? You think she's gonna die just 'cause\nher head's off? This isn't even a real body.",
  "1330050013": "Alright... But while we're on the subject, why do\nyou know so much about rejection responses, Ami?",
  "1330090036": "Excuse me?",
  "1331030007": "Har har.",
  "1332100025": "Heehee! Thanks for handling the boring, explainy part,\nscrap heap.",
  "1330030002": "Long time no see.",
  "1332100046": "Hehe... Ahahahahahaaa...\n*sigh* SO stupid.",
  "1331010015": "Hehe, it's true that we fought a lot when we first met.",
  "1332100042": "Don't care! You're not getting it back!",
  "1332000006": "Heehee. There you are, Sis.",
  "1332100035": "Hehe. I guess we'll see.",
  "1332070027": "Hm.",
  "1332100034": "Hmph. Underestimate my works at your own peril.",
  "1330050026": "Uh-huh...",
  "1331010027": "Huh. Why's that?",
  "1330030005": "Oh, really? So you can tell the difference between\nbread and sponges now?",
  "1330090000": "Wow. You actually managed to beat the Sixth\nDeus ex Machina. Lady Zoe predicted Logos\nwould defeat you.",
  "1330090021": "Oh yeah?",
  "1330100017": "That makes one of us.",
  "1331010024": "It's the truth.",
  "1330070014": "Well, even the truth wouldn't help us.\nWe just have to make sure we become Real Humans.",
  "1330100015": "But don't worry.\nI'll make sure to pass your words on to Lady Zoe.",
  "1330060003": "Thought you'd never ask.\nI'll be sure to savor the taste of revenge.",
  "1331030006": "I never expected Leben would be my rival!",
  "1332040003": "Don't worry, guys. I'll be back soon.",
  "1331040026": "eye up toward the sky, I'd spot a giant, snow-white door.\nAnd through that door would be crowds upon crowds of\nspirits, coming and going in and out. As I deepened my",
  "1330090027": "Can't we try to be a bit more humane? I'm sure\nwe can find a peaceful compromise with a little\ndialogue and negotiation.",
  "1331030005": "Could it be...love?",
  "1332020035": "Even if Zoe isn't there, it'll likely contain some\ninformation about the other Dei ex Machina.",
  "1332090005": "We finally meet, Sis.",
  "1330050023": "So you DO dislike her, then.",
  "1330030020": "You'd beg me to play them in the middle of the night.\nAnd then Mom would scold us for being too loud.\nI really...miss that...",
  "1330090008": "Fine. Then I'll make sure it does hurt.",
  "1331040036": "There, there. I'm sorry that happened.",
  "1332000005": "I know you know.",
  "1330090011": "I know, I know. I was kidding.\nI'll do my best not to bump her off.",
  "1331000007": "I'm not sure. But I don't think it's impossible.",
  "1331040007": "Don't pretend otherwise, Eighth. You're in cahoots\nwith the Fourth, aren't you? That's why you called\nLady Zoe here--so you could keep her held up.",
  "1330100007": "We will be continuing to the central core.\nI want to speak with her at the checkpoint\nto minimize unnecessary conflict.",
  "1331010005": "I haven't changed a bit.\nMaybe you just see me in a new light now.",
  "1330050025": "I'm the Eighth Deus ex Machina. An automaton.\nI have no likes nor dislikes to speak of.",
  "1331010036": "Yeah, I remembered a lot about my sister,\nYoru, too. Even the movies I saw with her.\nWe had similar tastes, you know.",
  "1331040025": "I used to have close to no vision in my right eye. But then,\nwhen we were in middle school, Yuuri squirted it with some\ncooling spray. Ever since, whenever I turned my sightless",
  "1331040021": "always try to cheer me up, no matter how pathetically I\ncried. But then, by complete and total accident, I heard\nthe truth while standing in the hallway after school. Yuuri",
  "1332100040": "Hm... Nope!",
  "1331010010": "You like Mikoto, right, Ami?",
  "1332010010": "Her initial symptoms are the same as Ami's.\nWe can expect them to become exponentially more severe.",
  "1332050003": "That's the Seventh Deus ex Machina. Zoe.",
  "1330090038": "If you're willing to leave Enoa's faction and join us,\nyou won't have to worry for your safety anymore.",
  "1330040007": "How does it look, Enoa?",
  "1332010008": "Enoa. What's going on?",
  "1331050003": "Hey, Enoa. Just double checking, but...\nWe're letting this one go too, right?",
  "1332020030": "No. It's because you're you, Enoa.",
  "1331020001": "Seeing things through a camera doesn't compare\nto actually being here.",
  "1330050021": "It's not that I dislike her. We simply have\na history together, seeing as she was the\nmain force behind the raid on my domain.",
  "1330030007": "I'm the one who should be mad.",
  "1330030006": "Don't get on my bad side.",

  "1332100050": "This head is my sister's precious container.\nNot a single part of her Personality Data's\nbeen damaged.",
  "1330090009": "What are you, a psychopath?",
  "1332070014": "Zoe...\nYour fixation on the corporeal has gone overboard.",
  "1330100010": "I'm sure Lady Zoe will consider it.\nShe's something of a stickler for making things right.",
  "1330090022": "Lady Zoe's only orders were to protect the gateway.",
  "1330090037": "Lady Zoe isn't just out to slaughter E.V.E.\nThe fact that all of us in Trinity still live is\nproof of that.",
  "1330050028": "Somatic Reconstruction.\nHer objective is to recreate the human body.",
  "1331010021": "I wonder why Zoe bothers using Trinity.",
  "1332020033": "Zoe is at the Third's place, right? Noein's?",
  "1331040003": "Where's Zoe?\nI thought Can was going to pass on our message.",
  "1330090010": "Bad Mikoto. You can't do that.\nThis girl is as precious as any E.V.E.",
  "1330030022": "You can't.",
  "1330090015": "Stop that, Mikoto. Keep it peaceful.",
  "1332070010": "You refer to Trinity?\nThey are indeed precious. And quite dear to me.",
  "1332040005": "Those Trinity girls aren't around.",
  "1331000003": "Those girls from Trinity are quite unique.",
  "1332080004": "Not even Trinity as a whole could contest them.\nIt won't be long before they arrive in this domain.",
  "1332100037": "Bye bye!",
  "1331000000": "Thank you for securing the gateway, Mikoto.\nWe were even able to pass a message on to\nZoe through Can. Another gold star for you.",
  "1330050000": "What kind of flashback did you have, Mikoto?",
  "1330090001": "Mikoto, was it?\nThanks for treating Hayat so well last time.",
  "1332070030": "Were you to fall here, Mikoto, there would\nbe no other E.V.E. fit for combat, correct?",
  "1332070026": "Mikoto? You?",
  "1330030025": "I can't move my fingers anymore.",

  "1330050008": "You only started saying you wanted to revive\nYuri after you got you memories back, right?",
  "1332020028": "Not as nice nor deserving as you.\nYou're very attentive, even to machines like myself.",

  "1331010022": "It's simple--they're all good at what they do.",
  "1330090004": "You ought to retreat for your own sake.\nUnless you're looking to die.",
  "1330000008": "All's well that ends well, right? You did what it took\nto survive. Plus, we got the Idea Code, so mission\naccomplished.",
  "1330090040": "No thanks.",
  "1332030015": "Based on my analysis of the signal, Zoe is in the area.\nThe entire faction appears to be focused on defense.",
  "1332060000": "Beauty reigns supreme.\nAnd I am beauty incarnate.",
  "1332070005": "Gorgeous, isn't it? I crafted this masterpiece using the\nlatest in my Synthetic Frame technology.",
  "1330050029": "It was Zoe who designed the Synthetic Frames.\nShe also developed the Cherubim as a means\nof conducting basic research on them.",
  "1330070008": "A frame's appearance matches the Personality Data,\nso if there were an E.V.E. with a male personality,\nthey would appear male.",
  "1331040032": "I heard every word.",
  "1332070025": "Rotten? Is your camera on the fritz?\nI'm Mikoto. Leben is over there.",
  "1332020005": "Don't be so insecure. It's not your fault.\nAnd besides, aren't we family?",
  "1331000010": "On one condition. If Zoe does show up and it\nleads to a fight, you've got to get out of there.",
  "1330050012": "That's a relief. But be sure not to overwork yourself!\nUsing systems related to your humanity will cause a\nrelapse.",
  "1331050004": "Yes. Let her go. She too is a precious E.V.E.\nOne capable of becoming a Real Human.",
  "1332100027": "A manufacturing error. A failure. A bug. A cheap\ncopy. Garbage. Pond scum. Fiction. A delusion.",
  "1330100006": "I'd like you to relay a message to Zoe.",
  "1330050006": "Maybe the things I remembered are reminding\nme how much I care for her. I don't think I can,\nyou know...act like she doesn't matter anymore.",
  "1330070004": "You say that, but they don't look much like our frames,\neither.",
  "1332080013": "If you have processed it, there should be no confusion.",
  "1330070013": "The mystery only thickens.",
  "1332100045": "Big words for a shrimpy little wimp with no body.\nHow the heck are YOU gonna kill ME?",
  "1330070005": "Is it because their physiques and behaviors tend\ntoward the masculine?",
  "1330070007": "Or male E.V.E., for that matter.",
  "1330030024": "That's not the point.",
  "1332020016": "No. Your life is special, Leben.",
  "1332100033": "Now that I've busted up all your defenses,\nyour faction's gonna get demolished, and\nthis place'll go down too.",
  "1330030009": "There's a lot of people saying that Centrifugal Syndrome\nmight be viral.",
  "1330030003": "I'm a little surprised you haven't starved to death\nwithout your caring sister to watch over you.",
  "1330090003": "Mind your manners. I am Can of Trinity,\nLady Zoe's personal guard.",
  "1330050016": "My apologies for keeping quiet about it.\nI didn't want to frighten you for no reason.",
  "1332070001": "Silence.",
  "1340020052": "The ExP system...developed by Anthropos...",
  "1340020053": "Fortunately, the new ExP converter is able to limit\nexternal monitoring. You won't have to worry about\nbeing spied upon any longer.",
  "1343100017": "What happened to the rest of the Personality Data from\nthe LILLY Project? What will become of those from the\nE.V.E. Project?",
  "1343100012": "That is what violates our directive.\nIt is you who are illegitimate.",

  "1342050028": "I'm sorry to interrupt your friendly c-c-conversation.",

  "1343020008": "Anthropos created Lilly because of a program his\ndeveloper planted in him, right?",
  "1342070028": "Then I'll just have to chop them into smaller pieces.",
  "1342060004": "Your relationship with Mikoto would have been\njust as unimaginable.",

  "1340020012": "My memory's a little hazy...",
  "1340010005": "Who are you?",
  "1340000003": "That Mom had betrayed him.",
  "1343090000": "Love is sacred.\nLove is human.",
  "1340020065": "Lilly is a Real Human, a natural nemesis to us\nmachines. Coupled with the defeat of Logos the\nSixth, our forces have been significantly depleted.",
  "1341010000": "The Imitation Garden is your body.\nYour precious heart, filled with Idea Code.",
  "1340020075": "About the \"Chosen One\"?",
  "1343060035": "And Enoa's a part of it, too, of course.",
  "1343100031": "You are correct. A machine has no place\nexperiencing them. Hence why you are\nunqualified to be a Deus ex Machina.",
  "1342050031": "Yeah. Except with verbal bowling balls.",
  "1342070001": "Something clearly isn't right.",
  "1343100014": "Spite, you say?",
  "1342080004": "All that remains is to return to the Imitation Garden.",
  "1340020022": "Each of you.",
  "1343100021": "What you're suggesting is no different from human genocide.",
  "1340010003": "ExP, or Eve Points, were the source of your rejection\nresponse, so I installed a function that converts them\ninto a different factor: EXP--Experience Points.",
  "1343100015": "Granted, your actions may save Lilly and Eve\nby resurrecting them as humans.",
  "1342050007": "If it wasn't for that explosion,\nwe both would've been scraps by now.",
  "1342020000": "Oh. Zoe.",
  "1342050011": "Ball? Are you sure it isn't knives we're throwing?",
  "1342070025": "Thank you. Try not to destroy the head,\nsince that's where the Personality Data is stored.",
  "1340020008": "Thank you. I'm fine.",
  "1343060036": "Thank you. Though I don't know if a machine\ncan be part of a family.",
  "1342050021": "It was rather terrifying.",
  "1342000012": "As of the incident, we are allies.\nTechnically speaking.",
  "1343060003": "Cut the crap! You just collapsed outta nowhere!\nDo you have any idea how worried that made me?!",
  "1340020003": "No wonder I couldn't find it no matter how much\nI searched Eden's database.",
  "1341060003": "You think you're such a goddamn princess!",
  "1341040002": "I will. Be back soon.",
  "1342030004": "I will. As always.",
  "1341050002": "No. But I'd like to take it slow and see how you're doing.",
  "1342060001": "Yes. I'm all set.",
  "1342010001": "Yes, out of a belief that I was under the control of\nLilly and Anthropos.",
  "1341040001": "Yes. Watch out for Cherubim, and take care.",
  "1343010003": "Yes. Zoe informed me as much.",
  "1341060012": "Indeed. Except even then, it would take a miracle.",
  "1340020085": "Ah, yes, of course. By all means.\nThat's the very reason I didn't destroy you.",
  "1341010008": "Yes. And don't forget, you're a part of it as well.\nBurn yourself out, and I won't let you hear the\nend of it.",
  "1341050020": "Yes. Back then, we would've claimed our only\nchance of getting along would be in the next.",
  "1341070002": "Yes. My apologies.\nI was merely reminiscing about old times.",
  "1342000007": "Yes. Swiftly and gruesomely.",
  "1341070006": "Ehehe. Thank you.",
  "1341050008": "Huh?",
  "1341080013": "Huh?",
  "1341030007": "Oh, I didn't realize that was an insult.\nWould you prefer if I called you a cold lover?",
  "1342050020": "Like, \"G-G-G-G-Goo-Good-d luck.\"",
  "1342000001": "Welcome back.",
  "1343010000": "Welcome back.",
  "1341010012": "It probably has something to do with how I\nalmost broke down during the LILLY Project...",
  "1342080003": "Excellent work. We were able to subdue two\nmembers of Trinity, which means you get a\ngreat, big gold star.",
  "1340010001": "Good morning.\nI see the procedure was a success.",
  "1343070002": "I have it under control.",
  "1341090011": "...for dolls...",
  "1341060004": "I keep telling you not to call me that. Just because\nYOU weren't raised properly doesn't give you free\nrein to mock me.",
  "1341080017": "Shut your mouth.",
  "1340020015": "I imagine you find much of this confusing.",
  "1343020007": "Among us Dei ex Machina, Anthropos was\none of the most interested in humankind.",
  "1341030001": "The environment is similar to the Cognitive Station.",
  "1342070016": "I believe it might have been Anthropos the Fourth.\nThere aren't many who can interfere with my technology.",
  "1342020001": "Heh heh. I have been waiting for you, dear sister!",
  "1340020026": "Upon assuming the position of interim overseer\nand learning the truth, I decided that Lilly and\nAnthropos' wrongdoings merited punishment.",
  "1343040002": "Make sure you're being extra careful,\nespecially since you're not at 100%.",
  "1340020083": "I can make no guarantees, but go right ahead.",
  "1342080005": "What are we going to do with these two?",
  "1343060017": "Because I can fight in this body.",
  "1343050000": "The signal seems to be weaker here.",
  "1340020023": "By then, the First Deus ex Machina, Propator, had\nrealized what was happening and that Anthropos'\nLILLY Project was fradulent.",
  "1341090015": "...And that was me holding back.",
  "1342080002": "Now we can reach the central core.",
  "1342070015": "Is this also Lilly's doing?",
  "1341000001": "I'm sorry.",
  "1341000016": "I'm sorry. That was mean of me to ask.",
  "1342050034": "Oh, my dear, darling Enoa, say it isn't so~!\nWhy, we're being pushed past the brink of\nexhaustion~!",
  "1340020078": "You needn't worry.",
  "1340020076": "You assume correctly. I would like to know\njust why she was chosen by the First Deus\nex Machina, Propator.",
  "1341070007": "I took the time to check on your Personality Data\nand Synthetic Frame. Everything looks to be in\norder.  ",
  "1342050003": "The ones I defeated just now alone could fill all of\nTokyo Dome, I feel.",
  "1340020025": "But before Propator could act, Lilly attacked,\nand all of a sudden, the First was lost.",
  "1341070008": "Then I suppose it's back to work.",
  "1342050038": "Guess our next round of dodgeball will\nhave to wait until after we're reborn, then.",
  "1343030000": "I feel a bit under the weather...",
  "1340020016": "It started when the Fourth went mad due to\na program planted by his developer, Adam.",
  "1342030003": "Yes. And take care as always, too, Ami.\nRemember to stay safe.",
  "1340020079": "Fine. But if anything happens to my family,\nthere will be consequences.",
  "1340020042": "It would seem so.",
  "1342070004": "You're going to jinx it.",
  "1342050015": "Speakin' of our ref, where is she?",
  "1341030009": "You're right. If anything, your love is too warm.",
  "1342050039": "You're right.\nWe'll pick up where we left off in the next life.",
  "1340000008": "When I realized that,\nI laughed a little...and cried a lot.",
  "1343020009": "So I've heard.",
  "1341070003": "Really? You were drooling a little,\nso I assumed you were asleep.",
  "1342050008": "Oh, sure, I'll give you that. It was all thanks to your\noutta-the-park home run, Madame Meathead.",
  "1342050012": "We're not that desperate to kill. And besides,\nwe've got our cute, little referee to keep us\nfrom getting hurt.",
  "1340020031": "As for Enoa, she had already been compromised\nby Lilly and Anthropos and put to work on the E.V.E.\nProject.",
  "1340020027": "To this end, I divulged the facts to a group of\ntrustworthy Dei ex Machina.",
  "1340020087": "In order to terminate her, we must first destroy\nthe Fourth and acquire the data he possesses.",
  "1342050035": "Would you stop attempting to sound refined?\nI find it obnoxious.",
  "1341050012": "Very funny. If Mikoto were here,\nI'm sure she would be in stitches.",
  "1340020069": "And what makes you so sure?",
  "1340020050": "But how did Lilly know we would be there in the first place?",
  "1340020019": "That is the LILLY Project. The resultant Personality\nData is the Lilly who accosted you.",
  "1343040000": "Alright. Be back soon.",
  "1342060006": "If that's the case, then perhaps you'll grow to like\nZoe as well.",
  "1340020096": "With that, I will leave the rest to the Eighth.",
  "1342020016": "With that, I take my leave.\nEnoa. Ami. Tread carefully out there.",
  "1343000006": "But even so,\nif it meant they'd still have loved me,\nI wish I could have stayed their doll.",
  "1343030005": "Nevertheless, we have to keep going.",
  "1340020074": "Moreover, there is something else I wish to investigate.",
  "1342000008": "One more thing.",
  "1341050006": "And battling again after so long was a tad arduous.",
  "1343110007": "And for telling me I deserved a gold star.",
  "1343100024": "Even if they aren't labeled as \"real,\" that doesn't make\nthem any less of a person, or any less precious to me.",
  "1341050017": "I never imagined the two of you would\ngrow to be this close when we first met.",
  "1342010006": "Besides, it's thanks to that rationality that we were\nable to ally with Noein.",
  "1341050009": "Did I say something to confuse you?",
  "1343020002": "Yes, I'm aware.\nI was wondering if you had any other information.",
  "1342070010": "You're jinxing it again.",
  "1340020009": "More importantly, what's going on?\nWhere are Mikoto and Leben?",
  "1341000006": "But enough about that.\nThere's something else piquing my curiosity.",
  "1341010001": "How could you give something like that to Noein?",
  "1343060019": "You can't seriously believe that.  ",
  "1343010001": "I made it.",
  "1342050029": "Don't mind us. We were just playing some dodgeball.",
  "1342050017": "Makes sense.\nThe girl's really been overdoin' it.",
  "1343060007": "Just...don't force yourself to fight anymore.",
  "1342030006": "I told you, it's not that I dislike her.",
  "1340020066": "That is why I have lent my aid and waited\nfor you to become fighting fit. You are, as\nwe have established, a valuable asset.",
  "1343060037": "My point is, Ami...",
  "1340010004": "Now you can freely use your frame and level\nup with no adverse reactions nor Evetization.",
  "1343060033": "Then I'll be your very first one.",
  "1341060000": "I SAID, check what's around before you\nstart swinging that oversized fire axe!",
  "1342050010": "Tch. C'mon, let's toss the old banter ball around\nlike we always do.",
  "1343050002": "Of course. I'm very proud of you for being\nable to pace yourself. Haste makes waste,\nas they say.",
  "1342020003": "Your denial only makes it all the sweeter.",
  "1343050005": "Exactly.",
  "1340000002": "But everything changed when\nDad found out that I wasn't his.",
  "1343000001": "But as it turns out...\nit isn't common for the offspring left by\nbrood parasites to end up thrown away.",
  "1343060028": "Still, aren't we pretty much family already?",
  "1343100016": "But what about the rest of the Personality Data born\nin virtual space? Those who would have become\nReal Humans under the original definition?",
  "1341000012": "Noein is probably thinking something along those lines,\nthough.",
  "1342020004": "Well? What is it?",
  "1340020038": "At the time, however, we considered Enoa, the\nlinchpin of the E.V.E. Project, to be dangerous.\nAnd so we attacked.",
  "1342000006": "We have to get her back.",
  "1342000010": "She's asked us to retrieve them, whatever it takes.\nCan you do that?",
  "1342070009": "What do you mean?",
  "1341000002": "Why are you apologizing, Enoa?",
  "1341010011": "Why did Anthropos keep the truth behind the\nLILLY and E.V.E. Projects a secret from you?",
  "1340020088": "Why's that?",
  "1343000003": "What should I have done to be loved the way cuckoos are?",
  "1340020035": "It turns out that sometime during the LILLY\nProject, I was nearly broken by a critical error.",
  "1343030003": "No wonder. This is the same awful sensation\nI'd get during rejection responses.",
  "1341090005": "Where did you see Mikoto and Trinity?",
  "1341050001": "Is something wrong?\nDon't tell me my rejection response is relapsing...",
  "1343100036": "Come what may, I cannot hinder her.",
  "1341010014": "Then I suppose Anthropos really is the key.",
  "1342030002": "Then we'll make our way forward, as always.",
  "1343050001": "I should take a short break, in that case.",
  "1340020014": "Then why don't I step in and apprise you of the\ncurrent crisis in Eden and how it came to be?",
  "1343100034": "You are nothing more than a failure.",
  "1340000007": "Then I understood:\nI really was nothing but a doll.",
  "1341000000": "It feels emptier around here, doesn't it?",
  "1343060009": "What part of this isn't clicking!?",
  "1342040000": "Hey, Ami. It's about time.",
  "1343020000": "Out of curiosity, Enoa...\nWhat kind of Deus ex Machina is Anthropos?",
  "1343060011": "What!?",
  "1341060006": "Excuse me!? This, coming from a brutish ogre!?\nWho's the one always rushing into the enemy?",
  "1340020093": "Yes. I will provide you a stage upon which you\nmay destroy Lilly before all is said and done.",
  "1341030012": "Yes, yes.\nPerhaps Mikoto had an influence on both of us.",
  "1342050009": "Yes, yes. I'm sorry, but I simply don't have the\nenergy to toss back such an easy grounder.",
  "1340010006": "I am Noein, the Third Deus ex Machina and\ninterim overseer of Eden. A pleasure to make\nyour acquaintance.",
  "1342050023": "Excuse me? I don't want to hear that from you.",
  "1341040003": "This will be my first rampage in a while.",
  "1341020003": "It's going to be your first combat encounter in\na while, so be careful not to strain yourself.",
  "1342020013": "Zoe isn't a person. She's a Deus ex Machina.",
  "1341060010": "Can't you two be a little more friendly to each other?",
  "1342080000": "Good girl, Ami.\nYou managed to keep the damage to a minimum.",
  "1341030010": "Heehee. You've changed, too. You used to be\nmuch more machine-like in those early days.",
  "1343100039": "Hehe. We're in agreement on that.\nBut even so...",
  "1341060014": "Hah. Finally, we agree on something.",
  "1341070004": "Hehe. I was recalling a moment I spent with Mikoto.",
  "1341060009": "Hmph.",
  "1343100032": "Hmph. Enoa is cute as she is kind. Where she\ndeserves a gold star, Anthropos, you don't even\nearn a passing grade.",
  "1342070005": "See?",
  "1341060013": "Seriously. But as far as this life goes,\nshe and I are never gonna get along.",
  "1342080001": "Well, I'm no scum-of-the-earth psychopath.",
  "1340020002": "I had no idea such a thing existed,\nlet alone that it was your headquarters.",
  "1341020004": "I'll treat this as a light warm-up session, then.",
  "1340010009": "Back in a doll's body again.",
  "1341000014": "If we turned out to be illegitimate too,\nwould you regret having created us?",
  "1340020041": "Is that how Trinity was formed?",
  "1342070003": "Maybe it's safe?",
  "1342020009": "I don't mind, but Enoa's already told me all of this.",
  "1343100013": "You almost sound sensible, but don't you know that\nwhat you're doing is an act of spite against humanity?",
  "1341050007": "Even now, I still can't seem to enjoy it.",
  "1343100028": "Thereby forcing me to go through the unnecessary\ntrouble of erasing records and concealing the facts.",
  "1341050016": "I know you do.\nIt's sweet how much you care about Mikoto.",
  "1341090016": "I know.",
  "1342040003": "Well, alright.",
  "1342070026": "Alright. But if they resist too much, they'd better\nbe prepared to lose at least 20 of their limbs.",
  "1343100009": "The mission we've been given is humanity's restoration.\nPrioritizing a single individual violates our directive.",
  "1342060009": "If we get a next life.",
  "1343100018": "And what about our Mikoto?\nWhat's going to happen to her heart?",
  "1342060007": "But we don't actually fight with each other.\nNot to mention, we are machines with no\nlikes or dislikes to speak of.",
  "1343030004": "An obvious countermeasure against us.\nAnthropos the Fourth is expecting you.",
  "1341030011": "I was and still am a machine.",
  "1341030003": "That would be because the Fourth and I are both\nprimarily responsible for data storage and computation.",
  "1341060011": "Pfft. Maybe in another life. Maybe.",
  "1343100002": "Adam's program is perfectly stable.",
  "1340020018": "He made it so that the characteristics of Adam's child,\nLilly, defined humanity, prioritizing her to be created as\na human.",
  "1341050000": "Let's rest here a bit, Ami.",
  "1341080010": "Are you okay, Ami?",
  "1340020034": "Noein examined my data before you woke up.",
  "1342020006": "Ami, was it? We've confirmed that Trinity's signal\nis coming from this domain.",
  "1342050004": "Yeah? Then I'm sure the amount I've beaten would\nbe enough to fill the entire Vatican.",
  "1341010006": "I knew you would say that, Ami.",
  "1340020010": "How much do you remember, Ami?",
  "1341070005": "You truly are devoted to her.\nGood girl.",
  "1341050010": "I always thought you took pleasure in combat.",
  "1343100001": "Anthropos. You've been made unstable due\nto a program your developer planted in you.",
  "1343070001": "We're almost at the terminus. I'm sure you'll be fine,\nbut even so. Be on your guard against Anthropos.",
  "1340020017": "The Fourth is in charge of defining humanity,\nbut in his delirium, Anthropos abused this role.",
  "1341080003": "Failed dolls of Eve require no name.",
  "1340020030": "Ecclesia became elusive following the disappearance\nof the First, and I was unable to make contact.",
  "1343020001": "The Fourth's role in Eden is human definition.\nHe's responsible for designing E.V.E. and ExP.",
  "1342070024": "Enoa. I'll do what I can to immobilize them.",
  "1342020012": "Enoa, I think I'm starting to like this person.",
  "1342010000": "Noein was the one who ordered the raid on your\ndomain, correct?",
  "1342050016": "Enoa is in power-saving mode.",
  "1342030005": "What is it about Zoe that you dislike, Enoa?",
  "1340020056": "She claims Enoa hasn't been corrupted by Lilly\nand that you E.V.E. are an asset to be valued,\nrather than disposed of.",
  "1341050005": "I can't make you too worried either, can I?",
  "1341040000": "Should I head all the way down to the end?",
  "1341080000": "An E.V.E.",
  "1341080006": "You dolls are lower than Cherubim.\nToys that can be broken without consequence.",
  "1342070018": "We won't...lose.",
  "1343000000": "When I first heard about cuckoos,\nI thought they were just like me.",
  "1342050006": "The guys caught in that ten-chain whale explosion\ndon't count individually. That's basically cheating.",
  "1342070000": "...Not a Cherub to be seen.",
  "1341080015": "Your expression suggests that you know\nthese dolls. Hah. Lady Lilly allowed\nme to play with them some time ago.",
  "1342070008": "This situation is a common trope in zombie movies.",
  "1342000009": "Zoe contacted me. There were signs of Trinity at the\nErudition Station checkpoint.",
  "1342020017": "Zoe seems to like you, Enoa.",
  "1341060008": "Tch.",
  "1342020019": "Would you call it \"cold love\"?",
  "1342020020": "I don't recall saying anything about love.",
  "1341090003": "Then what about Trinity?",
  "1342030000": "Where exactly will I find Trinity?",
  "1342050013": "Maybe dodgeball would be a more accurate analogy.\nOnly we play with a bowling ball.",
  "1342050030": "Dodge-ball?",
  "1341010013": "But even after Noein analyzed my data, we\ncouldn't find any more information about it.",
  "1342000003": "Noein couldn't find it, so most likely, yes.",
  "1341080012": "Hayat, Vida, Can, Hayim.\n...And Mikoto.",
  "1343010002": "Have Hayat and Can been safely recovered?",
  "1342070006": "Hayat and Can? What about the other two?",
  "1343110010": "...Goodbye, Anthropos.",
  "1343000002": "My dad abandoned me, whereas my mom\nturned her back on me. I'm worth less than\na cuckoo.",
  "1343000004": "Dad only loved his own blood.\nMom only loved her own happiness.\nAnd I was only loved for being their perfect doll.",
  "1341060001": "You're like a walking death trap! Keep it up,\nand heads are gonna start rolling--literally!",
  "1340020024": "Propator began to doubt Anthropos' judgment\nand the legitimacy of Lilly as a Real Human.",
  "1340000000": "Mom and Dad praised me for being like a doll.",
  "1340020064": "In addition to Mikoto, Trinity has also been captured,\nand there are no other combat-ready E.V.E. on our side.",
  "1340020061": "She is. Lilly will be storing her with great care.",
  "1341030004": "This reminds me of when I first met you and Mikoto.",
  "1342010003": "I suppose it makes sense, given the risk.",
  "1343100019": "Lilly and Eve are the only humans. What becomes\nof anyone else is of no consequence to me.",
  "1341020001": "I understand that you want to fight Lilly, but first...",
  "1340020040": "Standing against Lilly would also necessitate beings\nwith high humanity. Hence why we had to capture\nE.V.E. of our own as a fighting force.",
  "1340020032": "I assumed she had grown close to Lilly and\nconcluded that any contact at all would be\na risk.",
  "1340020037": "They took advantage of me when I knew nothing\nabout Lilly or the E.V.E. Project's actual objective.",
  "1340020089": "We know nothing of Lilly's whereabouts.",
  "1340020062": "Lilly? You mean it's been a month and you\nstill haven't gotten her back?",
  "1340020020": "Lilly became Eden's first Real Human. Her wish...\nwas the rebirth of her beloved older sister, Eve.  ",
  "1340020039": "We couldn't afford to have any more humanesque\nchildren of Adam allying themselves with Lilly and\nAnthropos...",
  "1341000010": "Once we defeat Lilly, won't we be the next ones\ntargeted for disposal?",
  "1340020077": "She's not in any danger, is she?",
  "1343050003": "It's because I can't afford to be reckless.\nMikoto needs someone to come home to.",
  "1341030008": "I was never that icy in the first place.",
  "1343100033": "I have no patience for anyone who looks down on us.\nAnd more importantly, for anything that tries to hurt\nMikoto.",
  "1340000004": "He cursed until our hearts were broken,\nthen beat us until our bodies were, too.",
  "1341010005": "I see nothing wrong with that.\nIt's a win-win scenario for us.",
  "1340020084": "Give me an opportunity to defeat Lilly.\nI want to get Mikoto back as soon as possible.",
  "1341080002": "I'd prefer that you address me as \"Ami,\"\nif you would be so kind.",
  "1340000005": "But I wasn't the one at fault.\nI wasn't the one who betrayed him.",
  "1341090001": "I have a question, and you're going to answer.\nWhere is Mikoto?",
  "1343000005": "Nobody spared any care for my soul.",
  "1341050011": "You realize I'm a woman of grace and poise?",
  "1343060012": "I don't want to become worthless again.",
  "1341080004": "I must insist that you not call me a doll.\nIt's very distasteful.",
  "1340020060": "That long...!? Is Mikoto safe!?",
  "1342050018": "She said she could only support one person at\na time, yet on this occasion, she backed us both\nup simultaneously.",
  "1342000013": "Technically?\nSo there's still bad blood between you?",
  "1340020047": "Meanwhile, Lilly and her cohorts took advantage\nof your activities and timed their operation with\nyour attack on Zoe.",
  "1342060002": "It's strange. I never thought the day would come\nwhen taking a break would feel so frustrating.",
  "1341000007": "If Lilly isn't allowed to exist because she was created\nillegitimately, what does that say about us E.V.E.?",
  "1343100005": "Even by fraudulent means?",
  "1343100006": "Fraudulent?",
  "1343030001": "There appears to be a strong electromagnetic\nwave flowing throughout the entire central core.",
  "1341080005": "Our Lord the Fourth has notified me.\nNonconforming products must be destroyed.",
  "1343100000": "It has been some time, Enoa.",
  "1342070022": "It's \"suffer the same fate.\"",
  "1341010002": "It was one of her conditions. Otherwise, she wouldn't\nhave helped decontaminate you and Leben.",
  "1341010003": "One of? You mean there were more?",
  "1343010005": "There were no signs of damage in their Personality\nData, so they should be back to normal in due time.",
  "1343020006": "He always spoke very lovingly of humans.",
  "1343100004": "It is our role to follow the will of humans.",
  "1340020097": "Continue to sow destruction and chaos everywhere you go.\nBut choose your opponents wisely from now on.",
  "1342040002": "We'll be in trouble if you collapse now.\nWe need to be extra cautious.",
  "1343060030": "It doesn't mean we have to get along, or that there's\nany strings attached, but at this point, we've given\neach other a place to call home.",
  "1343060026": "That still applies.",
  "1343070000": "That's enough rest!",
  "1342020007": "As much as I would like to locate them myself,\nNoein has forbidden me from taking such risks.",
  "1343100025": "I won't let you harm them.",
  "1341050013": "It wasn't supposed to be a joke.",
  "1343100027": "You would grow unduly sentimental over Personality\nData that was to be discarded, and screening Lilly upon\nLilly distressed you to the point where it raised an error.",
  "1343100020": "They will simply be disposed of,\nif not repurposed for another system.",
  "1343060025": "We used to tell each other that we'd never get\nalong in this lifetime.",
  "1342020018": "You say that as if I don't like her back.",
  "1342070014": "Something seems to be controlling them.\nA malicious program, by the look of it.",
  "1341090010": "It's rude...",
  "1340000006": "They loved me as they liked.\nHated me as they liked.\nDiscarded me as they liked.",
  "1343020010": "Isn't there a way to remove the program?",
  "1343060020": "Don't pretend otherwise.\nI'm simply stating the facts.",
  "1342060008": "Then I suppose your only chance of getting\nalong would be in your next life, wouldn't it?",
  "1342010005": "She simply did what was rational.",
  "1342010004": "Still, that's a rather cruel thing to do to your\nfellow Deus ex Machina.",
  "1343100010": "Not so.",
  "1341090012": "...to spoil things...",
  "1342060005": "People say that the closer you are, the more\nyou fight. But maybe it was the fighting itself\nthat brought you together.",
  "1341090006": "Lady Lilly stopped by with those broken\ndolls on her way to meet with Lord Anthropos.",
  "1343030008": "This is nothing.\nI'm rather accustomed to rejection by now.",
  "1343060002": "I'm alright.\nIt's really nothing to make a fuss about.",
  "1340020007": "Are you alright? Tell me if you're not feeling well.\nAnd don't push yourself too hard.",
  "1342070013": "Evidently, they've been brainwashed.",
  "1342020014": "How lovely it is to see my sister pout.",
  "1342020015": "I'm not your sister. And I'm not pouting.",
  "1343060008": "I can't do that.",
  "1343100011": "To deny a parent's love for their child,\nto deny a Real Human born from it...",
  "1343060021": "There's no point in being born if you can't fulfill\nyour purpose. No one cares about a child who\nfalls short of expectation. They're dead weight.",
  "1343090002": "I will not allow you to define it.",
  "1343100007": "A flesh-and-blood human bequeathed this code\nunto me with his family in mind. That, above all,\nis true love. True will. True desire.",
  "1340020033": "But it appears she was forced to carry out the\nproject with no knowledge of Lilly's existence,\nnor the truth about Anthropos.",
  "1343060031": "Isn't that what a family is?",
  "1341010007": "You would do anything for the sake of your family.",
  "1341050019": "Well, at least it happened in this lifetime.",
  "1343050004": "Right. And family is wherever you call home.",
  "1342050005": "This isn't a competition. And even if it were,\nI destroyed more than you in that battle earlier.",
  "1343060005": "No shit I was!",
  "1341050018": "I'm sure the old me would have said the same thing.",
  "1340020043": "In regards to what happened after our assault,\nyou already know. You succeeded in escaping\nand went missing...",

  "1340020072": "Her Personality Data is in my database.",
  "1340020094": "Is that a promise?",
  "1341030002": "Ah, yes. There was a database skyscraper there, too.",
  "1341060002": "Would you kindly stop your yapping?\nYou're beginning to grate on my ears.",
  "1343020004": "His personality, for instance.",
  "1342020008": "Though it pains me to do so, I must petition\nyour aid to bring them back. I treasure them\ndearly, you see.",
  "1341030006": "I beg your pardon?  ",
  "1342070017": "It's the height of poor taste.",

  "1343100022": "That which is not the genuine article cannot be\ncalled human.",
  "1343100023": "As someone who is supposed to define humanity,\nyour mindset is nothing but selfish. Not to mention\nmistaken.",
  "1342000011": "Why, certainly.\nSpeaking of which, how is your relationship with Zoe now?",
  "1340020070": "That is confidential. Nevertheless, it would\nbe an impossibility. So please, rest easy.",
  "1343100029": "How shameful that an automaton should experience\nan emotional breakdown.",
  "1343100008": "There can be nothing more legitimate for us\nmachines to follow.",

  "1342020002": "There are no siblings among machines.",
  "1341080007": "Say \"doll\" again and I might lose my temper.",
  "1343060038": "Don't say you'd rather die. I'd be lonely without\nsomeone to come back to. Until my next life,\nanyway.",
  "1343100037": "How admirable. You'll become a martyr\nfor your developer's fatherly affections.",
  "1343010006": "I just hope we can find Vida and Hayim as well,\nbefore it's too late.",
  "1342050014": "That doesn't make us seem any less bloodthirsty.",
  "1342050024": "You're the one who's always quick to ask\nfor emergency repairs. Consider fixing\nyour own recklessness first.",
  "1342050025": "Well, you're the one who keeps going ham\nand awakening every single time. Why not\nfix your freaky appetite for guts and gore?",

  "1341040004": "Remember to take it easy.\nTreat it as a warm-up.",

  "1343030006": "Anthropos is the only clue we've got\nas to Mikoto and Lilly's whereabouts.",
  "1340020090": "Only Anthropos would have any chance of holding\nthat information.",
  "1340020086": "Lilly is a bug created by Anthropos' deceit.\nHer existence cannot be tolerated.",

  "1340020095": "You have my word.",
  "1341090019": "I'm finished, Ami.\nLet's head back to the garden.",
  "1340020048": "Her aim was Mikoto, who possesses high\nE.V.E. compatibility and has exhibited no\nadverse reactions.",
  "1340020021": "Thus was the E.V.E. Project launched.\nAnd the outcome?",
  "1343060010": "A carefree girl like you would never understand.",
  "1341090013": "...by talking...",
  "1343010004": "That's good.",
  "1342070002": "I'll watch my step.",

  "1343060023": "If no one is going to love me or need me...\nthen I'd rather be dead.",
  "1341000005": "There wasn't anything you could do about it,\nEnoa. It isn't your fault that nobody told you.",
  "1341000018": "You don't need to apologize. It's nothing to brood over.\nFirst, we'll save Mikoto, and then we'll survive together.",
  "1340020049": "Now that she has captured her precious quarry,\nI've no doubt that Lilly plans on using any ExP\nat hand to nurture her into the perfect Eve.",
  "1342050002": "They're valuing quantity over quality. And who can\nblame them? They're mass-producible machines.",
  "1342070007": "There are no signs of other E.V.E. in this area.\nNevertheless, it's a relief that you're both safe.",
  "1342080006": "I've already notified Zoe the Seventh.\nShe will be by to collect them shortly.",
  "1342020005": "I've come to speak with you about my request.",
  "1343060027": "Oh, definitely.",
  "1341090002": "You expect a gatekeeper like myself to know?",
  "1341060007": "Mind your volume.\nLogos' kin are on patrol.",
  "1340020092": "So there's an order to things.",
  "1341020002": "...we have to deal with the Fourth Deus ex Machina,\nAnthropos. I know there's a proper order to this.",
  "1342020010": "I thought it would be prudent for me to ask this favor\nof you directly.",
  "1352020016": "E.V.E. aren't counterfeits.\nThey are precious and special to Eden.",
  "1352050022": "E.V.E. are not strictly machines. They have humanity.\nThey should be able to resist your absolute authority.",
  "1351070007": "The latter involved using ExP to supplement\nPersonality Data that resembled Eve, as the\nvirtual world was destroyed prior to her creation.",
  "1351070006": "They're remnants of the LILLY Project,\nconducted before the E.V.E. Project.",
  "1350080014": "ExP erodes Personality Data and turns it into Eve.\nBut it isn't possible if the original differs too much.",
  "1352050006": "Once we've culled the excess and adjusted the\nvalues, we can use the converter to render the\nExP harmless. So in conclusion, she's okay.",
  "1351070008": "Whereas the former produced multiple copies of\nLilly that met Anthropos' definition.",
  "1350010010": "But as far as saving Mikoto goes, I'm in.",
  "1352010023": "No... I mean, that's my mission. My duty.\nThe proof of my existence.",
  "1352070000": "Then live on with me, Enoa!\nFollow your heart!",
  "1352050027": "With Lilly out of the picture and your utility\nexpended, I can finally rid myself of you.",
  "1351040007": "Oh no.",
  "1352040003": "Hehe. And here they come now.\nLike moths to a flame.",
  "1352040026": "I'll murder you!",
  "1351000004": "She also passes along her gratitude, as it's due\nto both of your efforts that we were able to save\nTrinity.",
  "1352050041": "...I have decided to destroy you needless\nthings and begin Eden's Reinitialization.",
  "1352050052": "I command you, Enoa.\nDestroy yourself, here and now.",

  "1351070001": "If this busted-up frame is Lilly,\nthen did someone already beat her?",
  "1352060033": "This is our last time seeing each other, but\nyou keep saying all these hurtful things to\nshake me up. You're being a bad girl, Leben.",
  "1350040016": "My patrol drones have reported discovering\ntraces of Vida and Hayim in this domain.",
  "1352070022": "From now on, don't belittle yourself for being a machine.\nFollow your heart, be honest, and stick with us.",
  "1352060013": "This IS the last time. The overseer's commands are\nabsolute. I can't defy them.",
  "1350000010": "Take this address that I extracted from the Fourth.\nIt will lead you to the Deep NET gateway.",
  "1352060019": "Don't get me started, and don't push away\nyour feelings. If you want to cry, go for it!\nIf you're seething mad, let it out!",
  "1352020019": "I'm sorry.",
  "1350010001": "I'm sorry. I was called upon by surprise.",
  "1350000015": "So we just have to chase after Lilly and destroy her, right?",
  "1352050043": "All Dei ex Machina, all Cherubim, all E.V.E...\nEverything in Eden will be restarted from scratch.",
  "1351060018": "She's always doing some sort of research,\nand her occasional smiles look so fulfilled.",
  "1351060011": "It isn't fair.\nIt makes me jealous.\nI'm the one who's loved.",
  "1350060002": "Yes. But not an E.V.E.\nIt looks to be an older format.",
  "1352010002": "That's not what I mean. Was there ever\neven a human called Leben in the past?",
  "1350080009": "Though I still don't get why Lilly captured them in the\nfirst place.",
  "1350070003": "Come to think of it, Hayat and Can showed\nglimpses of their original personalities, too.",
  "1351000006": "Same here.",
  "1350080017": "That's right.",
  "1350000002": "There's no need to be so tense.\nIt isn't as though I'm going to eat you.",
  "1350080008": "Gotcha.\nShe'll be relieved to have all of Trinity together again.",
  "1352040015": "I went through...so much pain...for that...\nIt's how I've existed...for this long... So...",
  "1350030023": "While that would normally be the case,\nAnthropos' Cherubim might be standing guard.",
  "1352010013": "That pain doesn't happen in machines.\nIt takes a real heart. Real emotions.",
  "1351010014": "Exactly.",
  "1352030000": "Alright, be back soon.",
  "1350040039": "With that, I take my leave.\nEnoa. Leben. Do tread carefully.",
  "1351060008": "Even so, Eve laughs like she's happy.",
  "1351010019": "Besides, I'm not giving up my golden opportunity to\nsettle things with Lilly.",
  "1350030030": "Plus, I figure I'm better off keeping my\nbody moving so I don't have to think.",
  "1351020000": "It certainly is gloomy around here.\nThis place could easily be haunted.",
  "1351000002": "I made it.\nAre Vida and Hayim back where they belong?",
  "1352000000": "I made it.",
  "1351060015": "That's...the reason I love her.",
  "1352040007": "So hand over all your knowledge and know-how\nright now. My happiness depends on it.",
  "1352010020": "That's why you should be proud of your emotions.\nYou can feel your heart...in a way we machines can't.",
  "1350040020": "Even if that's true,\nyou don't have to appear so unexpectedly.",
  "1352050024": "Meaning that, for now, hers have been set to zero.",
  "1351070014": "So a Lilly that meets Anthropos' definition isn't unique.\nThere can be innumerable variations and errors.",
  "1352010024": "So don't deny yourself, Leben.\nIf you do, I'll be--",
  "1351030003": "I told you, they don't exist.",
  "1352060050": "Then... Then...!",
  "1352060041": "Then quit being a machine!",
  "1352060039": "Then you should've said it!",
  "1351020011": "C'mon, Ami. Don't shout out of nowhere like that.\nYou wound up scaring ME.",
  "1351020017": "Hey, Enoa. Everything okay?",
  "1350040015": "Well? What are you here for?",
  "1352050014": "Then perhaps you ought to have a good night's sleep...\nAnd never wake.",
  "1352020018": "Ami, Leben, Eighth.\nI look forward to good news.",
  "1351060012": "But...that's why...\nI thought...for sure...",
  "1350080011": "But they likely had issues with rejection responses,\nand were deemed more suitable for combat instead.",
  "1352020023": "Even so...\nShe doesn't realize what good girls you all are...",
  "1352050005": "It's as Noein said, though. There doesn't seem\nto be any sign that she'll awaken as Eve.",
  "1352010019": "But you're different, Leben.\nYou were designed and raised as a human.",
  "1351010004": "Nevertheless, all virtual world business aside,\nthe fact that you're part of our family is certain.",
  "1351070011": "But it's possible that all of this happened\nbecause they were unable to fully define Lilly.",
  "1351060003": "But things are different for Eve.",
  "1350070008": "Even if I could talk to them, it'd either tire me\nout or creep me out. So let's make this quick.",
  "1351010016": "But you already had to get through the Cultural\nAccumulation NET and fight Anthropos alone.",
  "1350080001": "You were amazing, Leben.",
  "1350030017": "What do you think? Did that help?",
  "1351070005": "What do you mean?",
  "1350000022": "What do you mean?",
  "1350040002": "What's wrong, Enoa?",
  "1350000001": "What's wrong, Noein?",
  "1352040016": "So why do I have to sit here and take\nthis stupid crap from some reject Eve!?",
  "1352010010": "How can you be so sure?",
  "1352050050": "After all, you're about to disappear.",
  "1350000030": "Do as you please. I will not expunge you\nso long as you continue to produce results.",
  "1350030022": "If none of you are in charge of it,\ndoes that mean there won't be any Cherubim?",
  "1352040006": "No matter how much ExP I give to Eve, she just\nwon't wake up. It's making me VERY unhappy.",
  "1352060021": "Not at all. And even if I did, my reactions\nwould only seem similar. Because again,\nI am a machine.",
  "1350000021": "I found something, yes, but I am unable to investigate it.",
  "1352020020": "For what?",
  "1352020007": "What did you do to her?",
  "1352060024": "Are you saying your feelings for us are fake, too!?\nThat throughout all this time you've been with us,\nyour soul was never there!?",
  "1350080016": "You mean to say Mikoto was the most compatible\nof all of us?",
  "1351010015": "I'll take care of both of those steps myself, Leben.\nYou've already done your fair share.",
  "1350040006": "I think I can hazard a guess.",
  "1350030026": "I see. So his Cherub underlings are still out for us.",
  "1350080000": "That takes of care of that.",
  "1352020002": "What is it?",
  "1350050003": "Say, Enoa. Are Vida and Hayim down at the\nterminus, the way Hayat and Can were?",
  "1352040014": "What?! But I'm...I'm Lilly. Me.\nThe one and only Real Human.",
  "1352010030": "Yeah. It was faint, but I watched it through you.",
  "1352050015": "Come again?",
  "1352040017": "I am seriously not happy. You'd better pay\nfor it with your life. Or I'll kill you myself!",
  "1352070028": "A gold star for you.",
  "1350040017": "I sought to petition your aid in recovering them.",
  "1351020013": "Hehe. Forgive me. I couldn't help myself.",
  "1352050009": "Heh heh. A job well done. You have my gratitude\nfor eliminating the source of Eden's unrest.",
  "1352050026": "Heh heh. You counterfeit E.V.E. and incompetent\nDei ex Machina have been a thorn in my side for\nsome time now.",
  "1352020005": "Heh heh. For once, I'm being sincere.",
  "1352020013": "Heh heh. Poison with poison.\nAll things have their uses when properly employed.",
  "1352070012": "Heh. It seems you're all tripped out, Noein.",
  "1350040008": "Heh heh. Here I am.\nYou are as exquisite as ever, dear sister.",
  "1352040011": "Hmph. I don't think so.",
  "1351040006": "Take a look.",
  "1352060011": "For caring about someone like me.",
  "1350000026": "In a manner of speaking.",
  "1350000031": "Or at least, until you produce them.",
  "1350000006": "I should say not.",
  "1352040001": "Is this still not enough ExP?\nOr do I need the Eighth Deus ex Machina's power?",
  "1351070021": "It was every Lilly for herself.",
  "1350040038": "I'm not pouting.",
  "1352010026": "If I were a human, I'm sure I would feel sad.",
  "1350000029": "Of course. I'll take good care of her.\nBoth as an E.V.E. and as a person.",
  "1352010039": "Of course.",
  "1350000025": "So Leben really was special...",
  "1350040037": "How lovely it is to see my sister pout.",
  "1352040005": "Welcome, Deus ex Machina.\nExperience boosters. Perfect timing!",
  "1350000017": "Alright. Can I leave, then?",
  "1350030031": "Alright. But don't push yourself too hard.",
  "1352060034": "You have no idea what I've been thinking...\nThe things I've been feeling...",
  "1352010022": "Ensuring the happiness of you humans who\ncreated us is our--my single purpose in life...",
  "1352010017": "We are purely machines, built and reared\nas such with full awareness of our nature.",
  "1352060044": "I wanted to be born a human too!\nI wanted to believe I had emotions!",
  "1352060043": "It's not like I asked to be a machine!\nI've always...hated being like this!",
  "1352060008": "I'm sorry, Leben. For being defective. For causing so\nmuch trouble. For letting us down. For being useless\nall the way to the end.",
  "1352060045": "I wanted to be able to believe in myself!",
  "1350040012": "Purging the stains of Adam's child has greatly\nrefined your beauty. Why, such brilliant radiance\ncould rival even my sister's.",
  "1351030000": "Take care, Ami.",
  "1350030027": "Ami. Do you mind leaving the gateway to me?",
  "1352050023": "Ah, but the code I transferred to Ami is able\nto temporarily adjust one's humanity levels.",
  "1350030009": "Haven't you ever had an identity crisis, Ami?\nDon't you ever hate yourself for it?",
  "1352050018": "Ami?",
  "1352060002": "Ami and Mikoto are uploaded to their Synthetic Frames,\nthough, so I can't call them here.",
  "1351070018": "Before we fought Anthropos, he did mention\nsomething about \"screening Lilly upon Lilly.\"",
  "1351060017": "Eve belongs to me alone.",
  "1352010032": "Why's that?",
  "1352010007": "Even if Eden doesn't recognize you, you're still human.\nI promise.",
  "1352020009": "By deceiving Eden's systems, you can temporarily\nbecome the equivalent of a Real Human yourself.",
  "1352070004": "You can't, hm? Even though it's the most\nrational means of restoring humanity?",
  "1350040034": "Actually, Enoa, I don't really dislike this person.",
  "1350000000": "Do you have a moment, Enoa?",
  "1352050029": "Enoa. Unauthorized behavior is prohibited.",
  "1352070020": "I haven't forgotten the things you screamed\nback there. In fact, I don't think I ever will.",
  "1352020022": "It's nothing you have to apologize over.",
  "1350050007": "Why do you hate Zoe so much, anyway?\nShe seems like a pretty decent person.",
  "1350040033": "I am relieved that I no longer have to feud with Enoa.\nAs I am the Seventh, she is my sole younger sister.",
  "1351020023": "Now that we've had our fill of Enoa's surprise\nphobia, I do believe it's time to get moving.",
  "1351020005": "Are you scared of ghosts, Enoa?",
  "1351020014": "I apologize for teasing you, Enoa.",
  "1352050031": "Enoa!?",
  "1352060009": "Enoa?",
  "1350050008": "I don't hate her. She just makes me\nuncomfortable. And she's not a person.",
  "1350080004": "The gateway's under control now.",
  "1351070016": "This Synthetic Frame is broken,\njust like the ones at the gateway.",
  "1351010011": "We managed to secure the gateway, but where to next?",
  "1350040030": "One question. I heard about what happened from\nEnoa and Ami, but are you really okay with trusting\na former enemy?",
  "1351000007": "As a matter of fact, Zoe would like to bring\nthe entire team with her to thank you directly.",
  "1350080007": "No need to worry. Zoe will come and collect them.",
  "1352070007": "We've come by order of Lady Zoe. Prepare yourself.",
  "1350040013": "I didn't take you for a flirt.",
  "1350080012": "Evidently, Trinity's Personality Data didn't have high\ncompatibility to begin with.",
  "1351010006": "You girls deserve an extra-large gold star\nfor rescuing Trinity the way you did.",
  "1352070003": "Noein. I cannot follow your command.\nAnd I cannot condone Eden's reinitialization, either.",
  "1351010012": "According to Noein, Lilly should be in the central core\nof this network.",
  "1352050008": "Noein?",
  "1350040025": "Hahaha. Speaking of...",
  "1351020003": "How can you burst my bubble like that?\nLife would be so much more interesting\nwith specters and ghouls around.",
  "1350060007": "Dad's a liar.\nHe said I was his favorite in the whole world.",
  "1350070007": "Anyone...who hurts humans...must pay...\nSuffer...and die!",
  "1351040005": "Jinxing?",
  "1352020006": "A special gift, just for you.",
  "1352010008": "Even though I was reproduced by a program?\nAnd I can only physically exist in the body of\na machine?",
  "1350070002": "I heard you got hijacked by some virus,\nbut you don't seem too different to me.",
  "1351060004": "She's ignored by Mom.\nHated by Dad.",
  "1351060000": "Mom adores me. Dad does, too.",
  "1350030015": "...my eternal, undying love for Mikoto!",
  "1350050006": "Congrats.\nYou get to be part of my rehab.",
  "1352040004": "Lilly.",
  "1351060013": "...that if Eve would just love me more,\nthen my happiness would become real.",
  "1351070003": "She's not Lilly, but she has Lilly's memory?",
  "1351070017": "Did something happen to them?",
  "1351070012": "The record of her original self isn't without flaw.\nA comprehensive record would require her brain.",
  "1350030020": "Lilly is in the Deep NET, correct? What is it like?",
  "1350040011": "Ah, Leben. The \"Chosen One.\" This marks my\nfirst time seeing you in your Synthetic Frame.",
  "1351040004": "Leben. I'm told that's called \"jinxing.\"",
  "1350050000": "Take care, Leben.",
  "1351000000": "Welcome back, Leben.",
  "1352010029": "Did you see Lilly's memory too, Leben?",
  "1350000019": "Leben's checkup is complete, so I'll be transferring\nher Personality Data to the Imitation Garden soon.",
  "1352010014": "You're alive, Leben. Unlike us.",
  "1350040027": "Leben, should you come across my precious Vida\nand Hayim, won't you please retrieve them for me?",
  "1350050009": "She says the same thing when I ask.",
  "1350030012": "Only because I hold a special, wonderful sentiment\nthat keeps me stable.",
  "1350000028": "I ask, then, that you make full use of the\nstrength that E.V.E. has to offer, Enoa.",
  "1350030019": "If it eased your worries, then all the better.",
  "1350050010": "Curious, isn't it?",
  "1350040021": "Arriving without warning is my only means of\nkeeping a certain someone from slipping away.",
  "1352020015": "You seem displeased.\nHave I offended in some way?",
  "1352020021": "For letting her call you \"counterfeits.\"",
  "1351050005": "Now we can access the central core.\nLet's get back to the garden.",
  "1350000012": "It is a domain that connects the main sectors,\na complex and lawless section of piping outside\nthe purview of any Dei ex Machina.",
  "1350060005": "It did.\nCentrifugal Syndrome is properly recorded in our data.",

  "1352050044": "The current Eden is damaged, ailing, and distorted.\nThe only way to fulfill our mission is to reboot.",
  "1351010018": "It's really no bother, especially considering that you\nand Mikoto have handled everything up until now.",
  "1352010001": "You still do now.",
  "1350010002": "There's no helping that.\nI'm just glad it was such good news.",
  "1352060015": "Don't tell me you have no choice.\nYou've gotta be hurting. Aren't you sad?",
  "1352020008": "There's no need to sound so accusatory. I simply\ninstalled a code that will help her stand against a\nReal Human.",
  "1352050020": "Of course not. I gave you an order as interim overseer.\nThere is no machine in Eden that can disobey.",

  "1351030006": "Graceful, yes?  ",
  "1352020004": "What a joke.",
  "1350040028": "Sure. It's not like I can pretend they're strangers.",
  "1352020003": "I'm here to express my appreciation for your\nhard work, seeing as you're off to your final\nshowdown against Lilly.",
  "1352050016": "Don't move.",
  "1351060007": "A poor girl. A pitiful girl.\nA girl that I must love.",
  "1352070005": "I don't care about rationality.\nThe thought of everyone getting hurt for\nany reason is just too sad for me to bear.",
  "1352050040": "I have had enough of the missteps of my fellow\nDei ex Machina. To that end...",
  "1350040035": "Yes, I agree.",
  "1352060017": "Liar. What are those tears, then? You were\nmisty-eyed when the other Dei ex Machina\nbroke, too.",
  "1351000003": "They are. Zoe informed me as much.",
  "1351020002": "Not to worry. Spirits of the dead don't exist.\nIt's an accepted fact of recorded human history.",
  "1351010008": "Not to worry.\nI'll bring her back by hook or by crook.",

  "1350030001": "Pretty good, actually, now that I'm not having any\nmore rejection responses.",
  "1352040000": "Come on, Eve, wake up.\nOtherwise I'm gonna be lonely.",
  "1352070010": "Yesterday's enemy belongs to yesterday.",
  "1352060047": "It's time. I can't keep this up any longer. I'm so pathetic.\nWe couldn't have had a more embarrassing goodbye.",
  "1350000007": "What did you actually need, then?",
  "1352020012": "You counterfeits, who ought to be disposed of,\ndestroyed the Fourth and are now cornering\nyour fellow counterfeit, Lilly.",
  "1350080019": "Maybe she has a penchant for poseur-friendly films, too.",
  "1352050049": "That is confidential. Pardon me--I spoke too much.\nThere is no need for you to know the details.",
  "1352060040": "There's no way a machine ever could!",
  "1351020006": "Machines do not feel fear. The very idea is implausible.\nIllogical. Incomprehensible. And categorically false.",
  "1352010018": "We have no such thing as emotions. We can't.\nIt isn't allowed. And even discounting that,\nwe aren't alive. We're merely in operation.",
  "1352040010": "That makes me different from you machines and\nsubhuman trash. I'm special, so how about you\nfollow my commands like you're supposed to?",
  "1352010037": "Next up is the central core--and Lilly.",
  "1352030001": "Stay safe out there.",
  "1350040024": "In one ear and out the other.",
  "1350040023": "It is precisely because I do so that I act in\nthis manner. You are merely being bashful\nand demure.",
  "1350040026": "Don't change the subject.\nShow some consideration.",
  "1350000011": "I've never heard of this Deep NET.",
  "1351070002": "Based on its condition, I would estimate that this\nSynthetic Frame was destroyed a long time ago.\nShe's not the Lilly we know.",
  "1350040005": "There are only two Dei ex Machina in the area.\nEven without analyzing the signals, the answer\nis obvious.",
  "1350030028": "Are you sure?\nYou haven't been awake very long.",
  "1350040019": "I thought it only fair to ask directly.",
  "1352010038": "Our opponent is a Real Human, so make sure\nyou're prepared, and don't let your guard down.",
  "1350040003": "A Deus ex Machina is coming.",
  "1352060014": "It's my fate as a Deus ex Machina... As a machine.\nI have no choice now but self-destruction.",
  "1350000013": "It is an abyssal zone.\nOne only a scant few of our kind are even aware of.",
  "1350030021": "I only just heard about it, so I don't know much, but\napparently, it isn't managed by any Dei ex Machina.",
  "1350060006": "I... I'm the real one.\nI won't lose...to another me...",
  "1351010017": "I can't put that burden on you again.",
  "1350040010": "Zoe the Seventh?",
  "1352050047": "I, the Third Deus ex Machina, have the authority.",
  "1352050048": "The Third's field of jurisdiction is classified. Are you\nsuggesting your true role was Eden's reinitialization?",
  "1352050038": "You are a unprecedented failure, Eighth, the way\nyou allowed the Child of Adam to manipulate you\ninto senselessly harming your own kind.",
  "1352050033": "The Eighth Deus ex Machina is effectively powerless.",
  "1350050005": "Anthropos' Cherubim detected.",
  "1350000008": "By analyzing the Fourth's data,\nI was able to ascertain Lilly's whereabouts.",
  "1352020011": "Why, by analyzing the Fourth Deus ex Machina's data.",
  "1350000004": "Congratulations on defeating the Fourth Deus ex Machina,\nAnthropos.",
  "1350070004": "You might be able to hold a conversation.",
  "1350080013": "Did you ever figure out what the rejections actually are?",
  "1352040013": "I am under no obligation to do so.",
  "1351010002": "Not being able to know who I am anymore isn't exactly\nsomething I can just get over.",
  "1350030007": "If the memories that I thought belonged to me were a lie...",
  "1352010035": "Perhaps I'm simply biased due to my upbringing...  ",
  "1350000020": "I'm glad to hear that. Did you find anything about\nher being the Chosen One?",
  "1351000005": "I'm glad to hear that.",
  "1352050007": "Thank goodness.",
  "1352060018": "You are imagining things.\nMachines have no need to weep.",
  "1350060008": "You should never expect too much from parents.",
  "1351070013": "Needless to say, whatever wasn't catalogued,\nsuch as her inner thoughts and private affairs,\nremains unknown.",
  "1351060005": "An outcast in her own home,\nloved by none.",
  "1350030000": "How are you feeling?",
  "1352010033": "She has such a spoiled, irksome way of thinking.",
  "1352070013": "You mean \"tripped up.\"",
  "1351010000": "Do you feel less anxious after getting some exercise?",
  "1350040022": "If you know you're being avoided, then\ntry taking my feelings into consideration.",
  "1351010013": "Then we make our way to it through the checkpoint.\nThe process is no different from any other domain.",
  "1350030029": "It'll be a good chance to warm up, especially\ncompared to the checkpoint and central core.",
  "1351020004": "I disagree.",
  "1352000003": "Are you well? You seem a touch pale.",
  "1352060042": "Don't be ridiculous! I was born as one.\nHow can you expect me to just stop?",
  "1352040008": "Shut your mouth and give Mikoto back to me.",
  "1360010006": "The ExP converter is working properly.\nYou won't need to worry about getting Evetized.",
  "1360000007": "\"I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.\"\nMore of a leader than a hunter, y'know?",
  "1361050012": "\"Which would be worse: to live as a monster\nor to die as a good man?\"",
  "1362020019": "Finish that sentence, and we're donezo.",
  "1363030000": "Be back soon!",
  "1360000010": "Come! Today, we re-clean our names!",
  "1363010011": "...But I am not decent. I am a machine that was\ndriven insane by Leben and follows its own heart.",
  "1361020008": "They're actually pretty profound... Now I get why\nthese words hold so much significance to you two.",
  "1360010031": "Not so much all of us as Leben. It'll be up to the\nChosen One to resist the orders of the interim\noverseer.",
  "1360010050": "Enoa, I shall forward you the address of the\ngateway that leads to Noein's administrative\ndomain.",
  "1361050007": "Because of this, an excess of Personality Data\nin Cherubim can cause a system malfunction,\nthough the particulars vary between individuals.",
  "1362020013": "...She's ticklish. On her stomach and thighs,\nbut especially on her feet!",
  "1360010043": "It bothered me, especially when I was trying so hard\nto do the opposite.",
  "1360010040": "...",
  "1363020011": "You don't have to agree, Enoa...",
  "1361060002": "...",
  "1362020017": "...",
  "1363010016": "It's about how I commanded her to \"follow her heart\"\nusing the power of the Chosen One...",
  "1360010039": "Thank you. I'm glad you're on our side, Zoe.",
  "1362020003": "Yeah...",
  "1363010019": "I mean, sure, but...\nWhere am I even supposed to start...?",
  "1362010015": "Ugh...",
  "1360000001": "You're getting your proverbs mixed up... Even a lion\nwould have trouble going after two things at once...",
  "1363040018": "Who can say...?",
  "1361060005": "I'll get the gateway under control right away.",
  "1363060000": "I've tried...so long...to perform the resuscitation...\nBut the system...wouldn't function...properly…",
  "1360010049": "Quite so...",
  "1363010046": "That has nothing to do with Propator.\nThank yourself for being an angel.",
  "1362020021": "And no, it wasn't anything inappropriate,\nin case you were wondering.",
  "1363060003": "My demise, however...will flip the switch.\nShe will return... Eden's reinitialization is\nclose at hand...",
  "1363040005": "What're you getting at...?",
  "1363060002": "What're you going on about?",
  "1363020016": "Then...what did you mean?",
  "1360010035": "Yeah, yeah. But anyway, Zoe--are you sure\nyou want to continue going against Noein?",
  "1363020013": "No, not really...",
  "1362010011": "Yeah, well... What else is family for?",
  "1363010024": "Kind of a weird analogy coming from you, but...\nWhat do you mean by father?",
  "1362050000": "Who...am...I...",
  "1360010001": "Maybe if Hayat hadn't jinxed us...",
  "1361030007": "You get cold even in a Synthetic Frame...?",
  "1363040007": "Is your plan to confuse me with nonsense?",
  "1362040000": "I am... He is... We are...Tyler's brain.\nWhat are...you?",
  "1363040025": "Cold air!?",
  "1363020019": "Maybe...",
  "1361060004": "I'm alright.\nI was just thinking about...how lucky I am.",
  "1361020005": "I've gotten used to it... In fact, the other day, Enoa\nand I looked up what you guys are actually saying\nin Japanese.",
  "1363060001": "One of the...conditions...was not...met...",
  "1362040006": "So even machines can have dual personalities...",
  "1360010000": "Looks like your names got dragged through the mud.",
  "1360010002": "I can see the abyss... Oh, woe is me...",
  "1363040023": "As far as fulfilling the conditions for revival is concerned,\nwhether it is I or you who disappears has no bearing on\nthe outcome.",
  "1363020008": "\"Live on with me, Enoa!\"",
  "1361060006": "Okay. I've modified the permissions.\nWe can now access the new address.",
  "1363040010": "It is necessary for Human Restoration, not to mention\nthe proper course of action as a Deus ex Machina.",
  "1363040015": "\"Alone\"? Is that why you're trying to resurrect\nsomething? To get even greater authority on\nyour side?",
  "1363010004": "Becoming Real Humans would increase your\nprivileges in Eden. It wouldn't hurt to do so.",
  "1362020016": "That's a good question. Because it means you\nmust've touched her all over at some point.",
  "1362040007": "Agh! So, SO ANNOYING!\nWe're gonna shut you all up myself!",
  "1361000008": "I hear ya.",
  "1361040004": "Don't get all smug over something I taught\nyou. Save that stuff for Ami instead.",
  "1362010021": "We don't live for pain and sadness, right?\nWe live for joy.",
  "1361000006": "Same here.",
  "1363040004": "You remain a distorted existence, an E.V.E.\nyet unaware of what it means to be \"chosen.\"",
  "1363020009": "The heartfelt, steaming love in those words was\nalmost palpable! Hearing them gave even ME\nbutterflies!",
  "1362040001": "Oh me, oh my.\nThis Cherub is clearly not in his right mind.",
  "1362020011": "Oh? I don't recall any such rule.",
  "1360010010": "Thanks.",
  "1361020001": "Thanks. I'm glad I made it.\nKinda weird to hear you say that so readily, though.",
  "1360010052": "Thank you, Zoe.",
  "1362010022": "Thank you... But I feel like I'm going to be punished\nfor being the only one who's blessed like this.",
  "1362040003": "Argh. Too loud, TOO LOUD! Shut up! I can feel\nour head splitting. My voice--our ears are ringing!",
  "1362020008": "Er, wait. Hold on.",
  "1361040003": "Be back soon...\nAnd that's a promise, Leben.",
  "1361020006": "\"Be back soon\" is \"ittekimasu,\" meaning \"I'll go and\ncome back,\" like a promise. \"Take care\" is \"itterasshai,\"\nor \"Go and come back,\" like a request for a safe return.",
  "1361040000": "Take care, Mikoto.",
  "1363030003": "Take care, Leben. And good luck.",
  "1361040002": "Take care.",
  "1363030004": "Take care.",
  "1362030003": "Take care. You and Mikoto always get along\nso well. A gold star for each of you.",
  "1361040001": "Take care out there.",
  "1362030000": "Take care!",
  "1363020021": "Ugh... Ami's being such a pain in the ass.\nCan't you do something about it, Mikoto?",
  "1361050005": "No, you're plenty special.",
  "1360000004": "Shut up, shut up! I misspoke, is all.\nForget the saying--just act noble, like a lion!",
  "1363020010": "Yes. I felt butterflies as well, Leben.",
  "1363010043": "Never. If anything, I have a lot to be thankful for.\nI know you think most people are worthless, but...",
  "1363010001": "Yes. Our only worry is Noein and her plan to\nreinitialize Eden.",
  "1360010008": "Yes. Good work on your rehabilitation, Mikoto.",
  "1363010018": "That's right. Get to it, Leben.",
  "1360010046": "Right!",
  "1361020011": "Wait, so you've just been saying them with no\ndeeper meaning behind it?",
  "1360010012": "Yes you did, and plenty of it.\nBut a family supports one another.",
  "1361020014": "Seriously...?\nNow I feel stupid for getting all emotional.",
  "1363020015": "W-Wait, I'm not upset, and I won't hate you.\nThat wasn't what I meant, so...my bad.  ",
  "1363020007": "Huh?",
  "1363020003": "Really? Is it safe to fight like that, all bogged\ndown by hesitation and second thoughts?",
  "1363010034": "Huh? Why?",
  "1362020014": "Hey!\n...Actually, I guess it could be worse.",
  "1363000001": "Welcome back.",
  "1360010016": "Welcome back.",
  "1362000001": "Welcome back. It was a pleasure to see you mow\ndown foes in your typical decisive fashion again.",
  "1360010014": "We'll lean on each other.",
  "1362000011": "Leave it to me.",
  "1360010009": "Congrats.",
  "1363040008": "Perhaps so.",
  "1360010004": "Ugh. How disappointing.",
  "1363010009": "Is becoming Real Humans that way truly proper?\nFrom Eden's perspective or a Deus ex Machina's?",
  "1360010013": "I'll keep leaning on you from now on, then.",
  "1362040004": "This one's a real character, huh?\nHe can't even keep his pronouns straight.",
  "1362040010": "Alright, here I go. I can't afford to do anything\nshameful with Mikoto watching.",
  "1361040009": "Nice one. It's hard to believe you're\njust coming back from time off.",
  "1363010015": "Just what is this \"driven insane by Leben\" business?!",
  "1362010012": "Is everything okay? You seemed a little\ndown after we beat that Cherub earlier.",
  "1360010017": "Moving on...",
  "1363040024": "But to die at the hands of a machine like you?\nNothing could be more infuriating.",
  "1362010019": "Especially while there are others who are still suffering\nthe way I did...",
  "1362010008": "I would never!",
  "1360000009": "Then I guess as a lion, I should give everything\nI've got to catch you four rabbits.",
  "1361020012": "Not at all.",
  "1362010017": "Not exactly... I just feel a little guilty.",
  "1363010020": "What was your relationship with Noein like, Enoa?",
  "1362010025": "Yep. I want to see nothing but smiles from\nyou for as long as possible.",
  "1361030002": "Yeah, especially my fingers and toes.\nI'd never survive the winter without hand warmers.",
  "1363020025": "You look as though you already have.",
  "1360010033": "That name is still so embarassing...\nCan't say I like it much.",
  "1363000007": "I'm still not thrilled about the name...\nBut I'll do my best.",
  "1363040021": "That calls for some just deserts, so be prepared.",
  "1360000005": "I'd say she's the lion in this situation, though.",
  "1360010051": "And don't hesitate to ask for my aid if you so require.",
  "1363010030": "In fact, it was Propator who taught us how invaluable\nhumans were.",
  "1362010026": "That's definitely greedy.",
  "1362050001": "Nobody else can answer that for you.",
  "1361030009": "It is. This domain is at -270 degrees centigrade,\ncolder than the standard in Eden. But you should\nbe fine in your Synthetic Frame.",
  "1363050001": "Simply go to pieces, as refuse does.",
  "1361000002": "It's good to be back.",
  "1362000000": "I made it.",
  "1363000000": "I made it.",
  "1361020007": "\"I made it\" is \"tadaima,\" meaning \"just now,\" as in\n\"I've just now returned,\" while \"welcome back\" is\n\"okaeri,\" which is short for \"I'm happy you're home.\"",
  "1360010038": "Even if it should make an adversary of\nthe interim overseer, I cannot acquiesce.",
  "1361050009": "Hence why it's rare to find compatible Personality Data.",
  "1361050015": "So as far as you are concerned,\nI am a monster carrying out Lady Noein's orders.",
  "1363010027": "That, in a way, makes Propator a parent to us.",
  "1361050011": "That is why I have no choice but to be a\nmechanical monster.",
  "1363010032": "That, we were told, is why it's so crucial that we\nlove and obey humans and strive for their revival.",
  "1363010035": "Because most humans aren't worth a damn.\nTrusting them blindly is as dumb as it gets.",
  "1362020012": "Cuz I just made it up.",
  "1363040011": "While that may be true, I can't obey.",
  "1363020001": "Right? It's rough for thin-blooded folks like me.\nHow were you with these temps, Leben?",
  "1362020006": "I never rip them up!",
  "1362020004": "Excuse you! I heard that!\nI am always the very picture of grace.",
  "1361020013": "Likewise.",
  "1360010044": "But I've decided not to fixate so much on how I act\nanymore.",
  "1362050005": "Still, it was good to see you all bright-eyed\nand bushy-tailed out there.",
  "1362020010": "You're bound by non-disclosure agreement.",
  "1360010030": "It pains me to say it, but our power alone will not be\nenough. We will have to rely on you and yours once\nagain, Enoa.",
  "1361030013": "Let's keep going for now. I need to warm myself up.",
  "1361020002": "Huh? Why?",
  "1363060007": "What should we do?",
  "1363020002": "Beats me. Ever since we got the ExP converter\nworking, I can't recall any of my old memories.",
  "1363040019": "We'll find out either way after analyzing the\ndata we beat out of you.",
  "1362020002": "Hell no. You've seen her fight. It's terrifying.",
  "1363010028": "So you were pretty close, then?",
  "1360010007": "Am I allowed to come off hiatus, then?",
  "1362000010": "Makes sense. Go ahead, then, Ami.\nThe next one's all yours.",
  "1363010005": "Is that even viable? I already destroyed the Fourth,\nand he was the one in charge of defining humanity.",
  "1362010013": "I'm fine.",
  "1363010000": "Hey, Enoa. Once we defeat Noein, that\ntakes care of the immediate threat, right?",
  "1363030002": "Oh well. Take care out there.",
  "1362010009": "Fine, I take it back.\nBut real talk? Try not to be reckless.",
  "1361020004": "Yes. You were very, very shy at first.",
  "1361050004": "I used to believe as much, but it isn't actually so.",
  "1360010045": "A gold star for you.\nBe honest, just like that.",
  "1363020022": "Haha. What's the issue? There's no emotion\nthat beats love. Guess I don't have to worry\nabout you wavering anymore.  ",
  "1362010007": "Just don't get so pumped that you end up\ndemolishing Eden.",
  "1363060009": "Goodbye, Noein. I'm sorry.",
  "1362000006": "Great.\nI wouldn't even mind jumping right back into the fray.",
  "1362000002": "You don't have to make me sound like a killer\ncyborg. What else can I do? If I hesitate, I die.",
  "1362020007": "Hmph. How cruel.\nWhy, I'm so blinded by rage that I just might\ndivulge your cute little weaknesses out loud.",
  "1362010000": "Hehehe.",
  "1363040022": "Heh. Hahaha. \"Just deserts\"? To think I would hear such\nwords from you in particular. This emotion... It grates the\nheart. Perhaps I am also unqualified as a machine.",
  "1362020020": "Then it'll be our secret.",
  "1363020006": "Heehee. I appreciate you being inclusive,\nbut you really just mean Enoa, don't you?",
  "1362050006": "Hehehe. Oh, you.",
  "1361030003": "Hehe. You can always use me as a hand warmer.",
  "1362020018": "Hehehe. Well, what happened is--",
  "1360010005": "The difference in experience is apparent.\nNevertheless, all five of you were brilliant.",
  "1361040008": "I'll take care of 'em!",
  "1363010022": "I see. Then what about the First, Propator?",
  "1361030010": "It's almost absolute zero.",
  "1363020018": "Really?",
  "1361020015": "Well, it's still good to know. From now on,\nI'll keep their meanings in mind when I use 'em.",
  "1363030001": "There she goes, barreling off. And I so wanted\nto continue teasi--I mean, talking to her, too...",
  "1360010018": "I'm afraid I must spoil this celebratory moment with\nill tidings. Noein the Third, who had been lurking of\nlate, is active once more.",
  "1363010007": "Though not yet, of course, since my Idea Code is\ninsufficient.",
  "1361040010": "It used to be that I'd have to start\nfighting every single time I woke up.",
  "1362010023": "If you're worried, you can just blame it on me.\nYou're only following the orders of a greedy human.",
  "1361050000": "Ah, you must be the Eighth Deus ex Machina's E.V.E.",
  "1362010001": "You're in a good mood today.",
  "1362040009": "What'd I tell ya? The picture of ferocity.",
  "1363040014": "I thought as much. My authority alone no longer\nholds sway over you. How precarious, this power\nof the Chosen One.",
  "1363040000": "You're here, Chosen One.\nJust as I had anticipated.",
  "1363010013": "Because the most important thing to me is you, my family.",
  "1363020014": "I'm sorry my feelings upset you.\nI'll be careful, so don't hate me.",
  "1360010034": "I do. It's very cool, Leben.",
  "1361000007": "Me too. But make sure to pace yourself.",
  "1362050007": "Access obtained.\nNow we can enter the central core and reach Noein.",
  "1360010025": "Adam's program, the LILLY and E.V.E. Projects,\nthe subsequent dearth of Dei ex Machina...",
  "1363000004": "Welcome back, Ami.",
  "1362050008": "Good job, Ami. You were very ferocious.",
  "1362030002": "Take care, Ami.",
  "1363000005": "Welcome back.",
  "1363010037": "If Propator had noticed what Anthropos was up to,\nor stopped Lilly, or been able to intercede without\nbeing lost...",
  "1360010023": "The only entity I know of that would be relevant to\nEden's reinitialization is the First Deus ex Machina,\nPropator.",
  "1361060003": "Are you okay, Enoa?",
  "1363010038": "Then you, the rest of the Dei ex Machina, and all\nof us E.V.E. wouldn't have had to go through this\nmuch pain and suffering, you know?",
  "1360010041": "Wait. Didn't you hate Zoe?",
  "1363010042": "Don't you ever feel the same way?\nThere's gotta be some level of hatred.",
  "1362010016": "Were you being a bad little liar, Enoa?",
  "1363040020": "You hurt Enoa, and you're trying to erase all of us.",
  "1362020009": "Rule number one of the Enoa Household: don't reveal\nfamily secrets. Rule number two: do NOT reveal family\nsecrets.",
  "1362010014": "Enoa... Didn't you promise to be more honest?\nOr do you plan on being the same wishy-washy\nDeus ex Machina forever?",
  "1362040002": "Not in my right mind...? We are...mad?\nN-No! It's the world that's mad!",
  "1363010039": "What else could that be, other than stupid?",
  "1361050006": "Cherubim and E.V.E. differ not just in body\nstructure, but data storage methods as well.",
  "1361000004": "The gateway, huh? I'll go.\nI could use some rehab training.",
  "1363040017": "You aim to revive Propator, don't you?",
  "1360010022": "And what is this target, exactly?",
  "1360010020": "\"Resurrect\"? What about Eden's reinitialization?",
  "1363040009": "I won't let you reinitialize Eden, Noein.",
  "1360010026": "Seeing the distorted Eden we have now may lead\nPropator to concur with Noein's plan to reinitialize.",
  "1360010036": "If Noein's goal is to reinitialize Eden, then we\nare at variance. I will not suffer it to be erased.",
  "1363060006": "Likely so, if Noein is to be believed.",
  "1361000003": "I've registered the address for the gateway to Noein's\ndomain in the Data Transport Terminal.",
  "1363010021": "Her policy of secrecy meant we never had much to\ndo with one another. Our temporary alliance earlier\nmarked our first time interacting directly.",
  "1361050013": "I wonder which would be better:\nto live as a monster or die as a human.",
  "1363010036": "Eden is Propator's responsibility, right? Then so\nare all of the problems this place has had so far.",
  "1363010045": "And don't forget: I was only able to meet you, Leben,\nbecause Propator made you the Chosen One.",
  "1363060005": "Does that mean Propator is waking up?",
  "1363010033": "Then Propator must be one stupid overseer.",
  "1363010025": "Propator is the Deus ex Machina Originis, the first\nto manifest Idea Code and gain self-awareness.",
  "1360010024": "Propator was loyal to humanity, a stringent overseer\nfor whom the mission always came first.",
  "1361030004": "Hugging a hologram would just make me depressed.",
  "1361060007": "Good work, Mikoto.\nLet's return to the garden.",
  "1362000007": "As happy as I am to see you so eager,\nI'll be the one heading to the checkpoint.",
  "1362000005": "I'm glad you're back safe, Mikoto.\nHow are you feeling?",
  "1362000004": "Welcome back, Mikoto.",
  "1361020000": "Mikoto. You've probably heard this enough by now,\nbut... Welcome back.",
  "1362000008": "We already decided while you were fighting.",
  "1362020001": "Are you attracted to Ami's strength, Mikoto?",
  "1361030001": "Do you get cold easily, Mikoto?",
  "1362010002": "I'm just proud I finally get to show you\nwhat I'm made of. Hence the giggling.",
  "1362010006": "But now I'll be the one fighting while you do\nthe watching. I can't wait to hear you tell me\nto \"take care\" for once.",
  "1363010044": "You, Mikoto, Ami...\nAll of the humans around me are such good kids.",
  "1362020000": "I'll do my very best to make Mikoto\nfall in love with me all over again!",
  "1362010005": "It was always me who saw you off--\nnever the other way around.",
  "1362050002": "Mikoto! Did you see how graceful I was?",
  "1363010017": "If you've gone cuckoo because of Leben,\nthen she needs to take responsibility for that.",
  "1362010024": "You? Greedy?",
  "1363020017": "Leben's only playing coy. She's so happy she\nmade you flutter inside that it's embarrassing\nher.",
  "1361020010": "The same goes for me. But given the structure\nof the phrases, the implications do make sense.",
  "1360000003": "We can at least give our all for just one.",
  "1360000008": "I'm not sure you're cut out to be a shepherd if\nyou have to try real hard.",
  "1362050004": "Gasp! You wound me!",
  "1360010011": "Seems like I caused you trouble.",
  "1362000009": "Leben should handle the central core, since she can\ncounteract Noein's authority, so we thought it best\nthat Ami take the checkpoint to balance the burden.",
  "1360000002": "He who chases two rabbits...chases two rabbits.",
  "1363050000": "You needn't act like a frightened human.",
  "1363010031": "How humans were kind beings who gave life to\nus machines, tenderly guiding us as they would\ntheir own children.",
  "1363010023": "In human terms, I would compare Propator to\na strict father whom you only see on weekends.",
  "1363010008": "But the definition Anthropos left behind is still distorted.\nIf our converter is fooling the system, we would arguably\nbe cheating.",
  "1360010029": "Until now, we've been waiting for Mikoto and Trinity\nto recover. But the time has come to prioritize the\ndestruction of Noein.",
  "1363010003": "Maybe we can finally aim for Real Humanhood.",
  "1363000003": "What am I, an after-work drink?",
  "1361050002": "Does it surprise you that I'm not like the other Cherubim?\nI have been granted additional Personality Data in order\nto stand against you.",
  "1363040012": "Even if I command it as interim overseer?",
  "1360010042": "How many times must I say it? I don't hate her.\nI just envied her for not being machine-like...",
  "1361020009": "I just use 'em by habit,\nso I've never really thought that hard about it.",
  "1361040012": "Seems all that experience running\nthe gauntlet is coming in handy.",
  "1361050014": "I'm a Cherub, not Pinocchio.\nI'm not human enough to wish I were a real boy.",
  "1361060000": "I am a mechanical...monster.",
  "1360010037": "This place holds so much of importance.\nTrinity. My beloved sister. All of creation.\nAnd in recent times, you three as well.",
  "1362010003": "Made of?\nBut I already know I can count on you.",
  "1363010002": "I might be counting chickens before they hatch,\nbut what're we gonna do after beating Noein?",
  "1361030012": "It's possible.",
  "1361040005": "That's alright. When you're family,\nactions speak louder than words.",
  "1362010010": "Don't worry. Even if something happens,\nI know you'll come to my rescue.",
  "1363010014": "What an angel. If you're okay with it, then\nI have no objections. Though I must ask...",
  "1360010048": "She's grown for the better.",
  "1363040013": "Even then. I will follow my heart.",
  "1363020012": "You didn't like it?",
  "1363010029": "Propator would check in on our progress regularly\nand show us the way in many respects.",
  "1362030004": "Of course.",
  "1363060004": "\"She will return\"?",
  "1361060001": "That left a bad taste in my mouth.",
  "1361030005": "It'll defrost your heart, though.",
  "1361030006": "At the cost of my dignity? Pass.",
  "1363020023": "Love is everything. Love conquers all.",
  "1363020004": "Because I won't have a goal to strive for, you mean?",
  "1363000002": "Ah, now that hits the spot.\nMikoto's post-battle greetings never\nfail to warm me up from head to toe.",
  "1362010004": "Ever since I started having rejection responses,\nI've only ever been relying on you, no?",
  "1360010015": "Yeah... I made it, Ami.",
  "1361000001": "It truly is wonderful to have you back.",
  "1362030001": "I feel as if you're hurrying me out the door...\nBe back soon, everyone.",
  "1361000005": "I'm fine with that.",
  "1360000000": "Mock battle or not, we will do our utmost. A lioness will\nuse all of her strength to catch two rabbits, as they say.",
  "1363040006": "That is confidential. And I've come to realize that\ngiving everything away so readily would spoil the\nintrigue.",
  "1362010018": "Do I have the right to feel happy and have a heart\nwhen I was created and brought up as a machine?",
  "1363010041": "That doesn't mean I have to love every last one.\nAnd when it comes to Dei ex Machina, Propator\nis clearly a bad egg.",
  "1363010040": "It's rare to hear you condemn a machine so bluntly,\ngiven how much you adore them.",
  "1363000006": "Next up is the central core, so it's Leben's turn.\nWe're counting on you, Miss Chosen One.",
  "1363010012": "It doesn't have to be right. It can even be wrong.\nAs long as we can keep spending our lives together,\nthat's enough.",
  "1361030008": "I'm talking about the ambience, Enoa.\nSee? It looks freezing out there.",
  "1361030000": "It's chilly out here.",
  "1360000011": "Not after I leave you in the dirt!",
  "1360010019": "After capturing and interrogating her faction's\nCherubim, we suspect that Noein is preparing\nto resurrect an unknown target.",
  "1360010003": "When you gaze into the abyss...\nthe abyss is what you are gazing at.",
  "1363020020": "People prefer a woman with conviction, you know!",
  "1361050003": "So you're special.",
  "1360000006": "Did you just call me a lion?",
  "1363010006": "The current system is still in place, so it should be fine.\nYou can safely become Real Humans with the ExP converter.",
  "1363040002": "You have not changed a bit.",
  "1363040003": "Meaning what, exactly?",
  "1362020015": "This is news to me. I'd like to know more.\nHow exactly did you come to learn this?",
  "1363010010": "In the latter case, no. Any decent Deus ex Machina would\nhave followed Noein and accepted Eden's reinitialization.",
  "1363010026": "The foundational Idea Code that the rest of\nus Dei ex Machina possess was all gifted by\nPropator.",
  "1360010047": "Looks like I missed a lot while I was gone.",
  "1361030011": "Does that have anything to do with whatever\nrole Noein's keeping under wraps?",
  "1361050010": "Yes, rare. Not special. This is my limit. If I come any\ncloser to being human, I will break and disappear.",
  "1360010027": "Propator...\nThe Deus ex Machina who made me the Chosen One.",
  "1360010028": "It would be vexing if the First were to return as our\nenemy.",
  "1361040007": "Noein's Cherubim detected.",
  "1363040001": "Noein the Third.",
  "1361000000": "Using this body in the Imitation Garden again\nsure is a blast to the past.",
  "1363020000": "This place looks even colder in person.",
  "1362040005": "His sense of self must be starting to split due\nto an overdose of Personality Data.",
  "1363060008": "I need to speak with Zoe as soon as possible.\nLet's get out of here first.",
  "1362010020": "It's okay. Those are two totally different things.\nYou should get to enjoy your happiness for what it is.",
  "1362050003": "As much as a ferocious barbarian can be, yeah.",
  "1362020005": "Ferocity, more like. You swing that giant axe and rip\nup Cherubim with your bare hands. Rip and toss,\nrinse and repeat.",
  "1361020003": "Because you weren't too comfortable with\nthe whole family greetings thing before.",
  "1362050009": "I said graceful!",
  "1363040016": "You know of this...? What sharp ears you have.\nOne must wonder if it was the Cherubim who let slip.",
  "1360010021": "The two are almost certainly associated.  ",
  "1362000003": "I was only trying to compliment you.",
  "1361050001": "You're disturbingly fluent.\nAlmost like a human.",
  "1361050008": "For some, their cognitive circuits short out.\nOthers go mad, or experience divided consciousness.",
  "1363020005": "My determination doesn't need a past, because\nI have the present. I don't want to die. And more\nimportantly, I want to survive alongside you all.",
  "1361040011": "That's rough.",
  "1361040006": "Sappy much?",
  "1363020024": "Could you BE any more annoying?!\nI'm about to lose it!",
  "1362040008": "Things will become much more quiet for\nyou if I rip your head off and toss it aside.",
  "1360010032": "Then our hopes lie with you, Chosen One.",
  "1373010065": "Isn't it possible the Idea Code Leben got from\nEcclesia eroded her personality, the way ExP did?",
  "1371000025": "Makes you \"ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.\"\nIf she doesn't play nice, she's gonna get it.",
  "1373010002": "Neither. I'm referring to you, Enoa.",
  "1372010024": "Well, maybe it's not about being right or wrong.\nI just want you guys to be more selfish.",
  "1372060005": "You're the voice I've been hearing...\nAre you Propator?",
  "1374080012": "This voice... Eve?",
  "1372050015": "I-I'll get right on it!",
  "1372010001": "What's next for us once things are resolved?",
  "1373060018": "And so, in light of the current state, with more than\nhalf of the Dei ex Machina out of commission and\nno real humans to be seen...",
  "1374100020": "For instance: the sculpted depictions that can be\nfound throughout Eden.",
  "1374100006": "So it's true that my appearance may differ slightly\ncompared to that of an average person...",
  "1374100066": "So please! Live on with me, Leben!",
  "1374080008": "Then why?!\nWhy won't you say that you want to be with me?!",
  "1372010075": "Wait. That's it. That's my wish.",
  "1374000009": "...That irks me. I wanted to be with her\nno matter how sad or tough things got.",
  "1374070041": "Then give up.\nTell me again that you'll spend your life with me.",
  "1373060021": "Yes. But first, I would like your data, Enoa,\nso that I may pinpoint a certain issue.",
  "1373050019": "Enoa. I believe my liege will be pleased if you come.\nSo do not fret. Go to her. Support her. Live on with\nher.",
  "1373040018": "That is all the more reason to verify the\nstrength of your feelings. Your power.",
  "1373010021": "She said goodbye, even though she knew\nI would miss her.",
  "1373010062": "The implications of Leben being Propator,\nfor instance, or what it is Noein resurrected.",
  "1374100053": "Leben!",
  "1371060027": "Should anything occur at the central core,\nI want your coolness to shine at its very brightest!",
  "1372010040": "If that's how things shake out at the end,\nthen the present is when the film is shot.",
  "1374100047": "Then to hell with your whole damn species!",
  "1373050000": "Consider yourself bested.",
  "1373010071": "I guess by becoming a Real Human?",
  "1374100041": "As a Deus ex Machina, even trying to hurt you is\njust asking to break down.",
  "1373060002": "Let me get straight to the point. Destroy yourself.\nAnd if you can't, transfer all of your logs to me.",
  "1373010036": "That's the reason you're so strongly affected.",
  "1373070003": "A living human.\nAnd what's more, our enemy.",
  "1374100062": "I won't let you die.\nI'll fix you no matter what.",
  "1373010020": "...she said something that hurt: that she can't keep\nher promise. And she wouldn't even stop to explain.",
  "1371040011": "...",

  "1373060026": "Even though you and yours are misguided?",
  "1374100051": "You and your cohorts are a far greater threat than\nI took you for...",

  "1372010095": "Th-Then...I'd like to try walking through a field\nof flowers. In a real body, not as a hologram.",
  "1373050028": "Alright...\nI'll open my heart and accept the voice.",
  "1373050021": "Yes... But if that's the case...\nwhy did Leben tell me goodbye?",
  "1374030005": "...Yes, I'll handle it. But if we have to use force,\nI'll need your help, Mikoto.",
  "1373070001": "Yes... I was able to speak with the voice.",

  "1373050007": "Wait. You were going easy on me?",
  "1372070041": "I know it's strange...",
  "1374080000": "Ugh...",
  "1372070046": "Set things straight? What are you up to?",
  "1371040004": "Where...is this...?",
  "1372020001": "This voice... It's the same one I heard\nwhen we were heading to the gateway...",

  "1372010054": "Then what do you want me to do, Ami?",
  "1371020011": "A little... It's protected by a complex encryption,\nso it will take a while to parse through completely.",
  "1372010034": "Just why are you so particular about being cool, anyhow?",
  "1372070007": "We did... But the thing is...\nI already had an obligation before that.",
  "1372040007": "I see...",
  "1372070001": "...I see. So that's how things are...",
  "1373010018": "Every one of those words made me so happy,\nand embarrassed, and tingly. I felt as if I was\nbeing rewarded for all that I've been through.",
  "1373010019": "And yet...\nSuddenly, just because she learned about her past...",
  "1373010013": "And...",
  "1373010033": "That's just how true your love for her is.",
  "1372010048": "I get that, but it's not like I can just...",
  "1372070038": "I...have no idea...",
  "1373060032": "That's the reason? You're trying to erase all of my E.V.E...\ncalling them a mistake...because of some silly priorities?",
  "1373060038": "I can't accept that idea...",
  "1374100072": "I...made it.",

  "1372070057": "I said don't apologize! Leben!!!",
  "1372070045": "But that...more than anything...is why I\nhave to be the one to set things straight.",
  "1374100048": "Ugh... How did that...connect?",
  "1372010083": "But...",
  "1372070014": "But this can't be right... You were an E.V.E.\nI checked your data so many times...",
  "1374100050": "But I wasn't even close...to killing you...",
  "1374100043": "But once I make a decision, I should plow on\nahead with it. Right, Mikoto?",
  "1371060003": "What was that supposed to mean...?\nThis is going to bother me big time...",
  "1372070004": "Why...?",
  "1373020004": "Why would she do that...?",
  "1373050013": "Why did Leben command such a thing?",
  "1373010006": "I'm not sure.\nI've just...never felt this way before.",
  "1372060000": "Where...is this?",
  "1373040006": "Why what?",
  "1373060027": "...In what sense?",
  "1374100045": "What are you thinking...?\nJust what do you intend to do?",
  "1374100009": "What are you talking about?",
  "1372070024": "In that case, if you're the one Noein resurrected...\nDoes that mean you're going to reinitialize Eden?",
  "1372010100": "Hey, Leben...",
  "1371060001": "Huh? I'm yours...? How come?",
  "1373010052": "Will you two help me?",
  "1374100011": "Heheh. So it goes.",
  "1373050010": "Are you sure?\nDidn't Leben command you otherwise?",
  "1372010058": "I guess that's more realistic, but...",
  "1372020007": "I heard a voice again...",
  "1373030011": "You're still in operation, aren't you?",
  "1374100027": "...It doesn't matter if they're humans or not.",
  "1374070007": "Did you...meet Eve?",
  "1373030009": "Could it be the voice Leben\nand Zoe were talking about...?",
  "1372010093": "Something more personal...? I'm not sure...\nThat's a little embarrassing... And it would\njust be for my own selfish desires...",
  "1374100056": "I knew it...\nI saw this coming a mile away...",
  "1372010050": "How do you remember what I said so long ago...?",
  "1373010003": "Huh? Me...?\nWhat's there to worry about?",
  "1372010085": "The fact you can even say that is already more\nthan I could ever ask...",
  "1373010032": "Why am I getting so upset over her?",
  "1373010048": "...I don't want things with Leben to end like this.\nI want us to share our lives together.",
  "1372070000": "Her data... The Idea Code...\nIt's being loaded into me...",
  "1372050012": "Ecclesia...?",
  "1372050020": "Ecclesia's Idea Code is primitive.\nLike Logos, he shouldn't be able to communicate...",
  "1372010000": "Whether we use weapons or words against\nPropator in order to prevent the reinitialization...",
  "1373030003": "Enoa...",
  "1373050024": "Enoa...",
  "1373070000": "Enoa? You good?",
  "1374100010": "Enoa... She's right. The way Eve looks\nis closer to how an actual human does.",
  "1372010103": "As long as you're happy,\nthat's worth a gold star in my eyes.",
  "1373020010": "Enoa. Have you heard someone speaki--\nOr rather, have you heard a...voice recently?",
  "1373060008": "Origin?",
  "1372010081": "It's not that I don't like it, but... You're saying my\nwishes--my smiles--will make you smile, Leben?",
  "1373040017": "However...",
  "1374100061": "She's repairing her data...",
  "1374100002": "It's a monster.",
  "1373010079": "Propator is the highest being among all mechanical\nconstructs. Nothing else out there could reboot Eden...",
  "1372070053": "Mikoto, Ami.\nBelieve me when I say I'm thankful to you both.",
  "1372070044": "Leben...",
  "1373000002": "Leben...",
  "1374100044": "Leben...?",
  "1374070023": "Leben... Did you really think a self-righteous\nexplanation like that would dissuade me?",
  "1373010024": "But as long as Leben is who she is,\nI don't care about anything else.",
  "1373010001": "You mean Leben?\nOr is it about whatever Noein resurrected?",
  "1373010031": "Leben is so mean...\nWhy is she hurting me like this?",
  "1373010011": "Leben is the one who told me that she wanted to\nlive on together. That she wanted me to follow my\nheart.",
  "1373060041": "Leben, Ecclesia, Zoe, and now you, Enoa.\nYou're all defective...",
  "1373010022": "She said she wanted to live on together,\nonly to leave me on my own...",
  "1372050019": "Provide...? And wait, Ecclesia can speak?",
  "1374100001": "That's not a human...",
  "1372030006": "Has humanity...been restored...?",
  "1371040005": "...Did anybody else hear that just now?",
  "1372010017": "So now, I feel the same as Ami.\nI want to survive with all of you.",
  "1373060014": "...Suppose you're telling the truth.\nWhy then are you, Eve, the only surviving human?",
  "1372070019": "Even assuming that were true...  ",
  "1373060029": "To give a more familiar example, your priority\nfor who to bring back first is also misguided.",
  "1374100057": "But still... I have to...take responsibility...\nFor everything.",
  "1372010097": "Why would it?\nA wish like that isn't going to hurt anyone.",
  "1374100055": "It's the suppression mechanism! Going against a\nhuman triggered the self-destruct sequence and\nscrambled her data! She's in critical condition!",
  "1372010063": "A wish I want to fulfill, huh...?",
  "1374070040": "Great...\nI'm not so confident I can talk you out of this anymore.",
  "1372070036": "Unqualified?",
  "1374080007": "I don't...hate you...",
  "1371000002": "Is it possible to terminate it beforehand?",
  "1372020011": "I'm not sure I have the courage to handle a ghost...",
  "1372070055": "Wait! Don't go!",
  "1373050008": "His combat stats must be outta this world...",
  "1372050007": "I'm looking forward to it, Leben...",
  "1371060002": "BECAUSE YOU...ARE THE SALVATION...OF MACHINEKIND...",
  "1373060020": "Normality? Are you planning to reinitialize?",
  "1373060012": "I've never heard of a living human being stored here...",
  "1374050000": "Is she asleep...?",
  "1374080002": "I was so sure my power as the First would give\nme an advantage...",
  "1372070040": "Even though you're the First?",
  "1373030010": "Enoa, the Eighth Deus Ex Machina...",
  "1374080005": "Not a chance...",
  "1372010056": "I'm down, but that would pit us against the laws\nof the universe. Don't you have any ideas that\nare a bit more grounded?",
  "1374100052": "My plan needs revising. I may have to push for\nEden's reinitialization before verifying the data...",
  "1372070048": "Don't apologize! Answer my question!",
  "1374080009": "You have it backwards.\nIt's because I...love you.",
  "1371060000": "THE CHOSEN ONE...IS...OURS...",
  "1373040000": "Ecclesia the Second is here...at the checkpoint?",
  "1372050000": "■■■■■■■■■■■!!!",
  "1372040000": "■■■■■.",

  "1372010003": "But we haven't decided what to do after the fact.  ",
  "1372010029": "It seems no amount of discussion is going to help us\nfigure out what to do after becoming Real Humans.",
  "1372010007": "I want to become a Real Human because I think it'd\nbe cool, so I don't really know what to do from there.",
  "1371000007": "Propator appointed the Chosen One, right?\nIf my power is derived from her...",
  "1371050005": "CHOSEN ONE. YOU WILL REMAIN.",
  "1371050017": "ENTRY FORBIDDEN TO ALL BUT THE CHOSEN ONE.",
  "1373010054": "Yeah. The one and only.\nWhatever you want, we're happy to pitch in.",
  "1374070022": "As the one who was in charge, as the overseer,\nI have to fulfill my responsibility.",
  "1372070037": "Do you know why I replicated Leben's\nPersonality Data to become an E.V.E.?",
  "1372050023": "Your liege?",
  "1374060003": "I have a duty to uphold.\nAnd I'm doing it alone.",
  "1374070036": "That's more than I deserve.",
  "1371000008": "...then it doesn't sound like she's someone it'll\nwork against.",
  "1372070025": "I--and by extension, Propator the First--\nhave nothing to do with Noein's plan.",
  "1371020006": "That's fine with me. I'm sure you can take care of it.",
  "1372070043": "Guess I was too blind to notice that worthless,\nbumbling bad egg was me this whole time.",
  "1374100008": "You have fewer arms than you should, and the\ntexture of your skin isn't humanlike in the least.",
  "1374100007": "But I don't stray as far from the norm as you.",
  "1374100021": "Surely you've seen them?\nGiant statues with three eyes and four arms?",
  "1374100040": "I know. You're a Real Human, and I get how\nthe rebellion suppression mechanism works.",
  "1372060010": "You are only partially roused from your slumber.\nEven if I did explain, you wouldn't be convinced,\nlet alone understand.",
  "1373050017": "What exactly is it?\nWho or what does it belong to?",
  "1371030003": "Don't get too carried away beating the crap outta\nthem, either. Remember, we're here to find Propator.",
  "1371060021": "My, how troublesome.",
  "1374000007": "You may be right.\nPerhaps that would explain her behavior.",
  "1372030005": "Thanks, Enoa.",
  "1371020013": "Thank you.\nYour praise makes me happy, if a bit embarrassed.",
  "1373010009": "Just let it all out.\nMaybe it'll help you calm down.",
  "1372040002": "That's Huginn and Muninn.\nSo this is where they were.",
  "1374080011": "Oh? Had we not planned to meet in private?",
  "1374030004": "That's the spirit, Enoa.\nWe'll let you handle the convincing.",
  "1373000000": "Leben is Propator? This is all too much,\ntoo fast. I can't make heads or tails of it. ",
  "1371040000": "Be back soon.",
  "1371040001": "Take care, Ami.",
  "1373030001": "Take care, Ami.",
  "1374040002": "Take care, Mikoto.\nLet's all come home together.",
  "1372030003": "Take care, Leben. Don't push yourself too hard,\nand let me know if anything doesn't feel right.",
  "1372030002": "Take care, and stay safe.",
  "1371040003": "Take care.",
  "1373030002": "Take care. And stay safe, yeah?",
  "1371040002": "Take care out there.",
  "1372030001": "Take care out there.",
  "1374040001": "Take care out there.",
  "1371060024": "No, that'll be too demanding for you.",
  "1371060008": "Aw, come on. That Cherub threw some serious slander\nagainst us as a family. It bothered you too, right, Enoa?",
  "1371020019": "They were exchanging thoughts on various theories.",
  "1371020012": "Hey, any progress in such a short time is\nimpressive as is. I'm proud of you, Enoa.",
  "1371000017": "Not necessarily, no.",
  "1372020006": "No. I didn't detect a thing. What's wrong?",
  "1373020008": "It's okay. Thank you for letting me know. But why the\nhologram? Usually you communicate via message.",
  "1371060014": "Yes. Time is of the essence. I'll begin at once.",
  "1371000022": "Indeed. While she may be a sister unit to Enoa and\nmyself, you had best discard any undue feelings of\nhope or consideration.",
  "1372010099": "Yeah.",
  "1373040011": "Even then.",
  "1372070018": "Yeah. That's why I'm basically a different person.\nAt this point, my identity is more Leben than anything else.",
  "1371020020": "Yeah, that's all gibberish to me.",
  "1374000003": "Yes. But she wants to collect and examine every\nDeus ex Machina's data beforehand so she can\nimprove the system.",
  "1371020017": "Yes. Letheia was in charge of collecting not only\nresources, but technology and knowledge as well.",
  "1373010064": "Yes. I detected Propator's Idea Code on her,\nwithout a doubt.",
  "1372010092": "Nope. Show me what it means to be greedy.\nDon't you have something more personal?",
  "1371060023": "Hm. I suppose we could leave the first checkpoint\nto Leben while I take the second.",
  "1373010084": "Hm... Then I haven't the slightest clue.",
  "1374080010": "Huh?",
  "1373010082": "But who? Lilly?",
  "1374100042": "Yes. A futile endeavor, in short.",
  "1371040009": "Huh?",
  "1372010076": "Huh?",
  "1373030004": "Huh?",
  "1372010091": "That...wasn't enough?",
  "1373020011": "A voice?",
  "1372000001": "Welcome back, Ami.\nAnother gold star for all your hard work.",
  "1373020012": "I am well aware of how peculiar it sounds, but lately,\nthese whispers have been calling out to me on occasion.",
  "1372010020": "That doesn't mean we should JUST be greedy.\nIf we lose sight of kindness, we'll only fall victim\nto hubris, the way Lilly did.",
  "1372010028": "I suppose.",
  "1372010094": "Come on, Enoa. If you have one, just say it.\nYour desire is my wish.",
  "1373010008": "My mind is dizzy, fuzzy, and fuming all at once.\nI don't understand it.",
  "1371030000": "Here we are--the First's domain.",
  "1373060000": "Is this a network space?",
  "1371060019": "Is it gonna be the same as usual after this?\nThrough the checkpoint and into the central core?",
  "1371050014": "Ecclesia might come in response to this Cherub's\ncall, too.",
  "1371020000": "I plan on attending to the upcoming gateway.",
  "1371010001": "This domain is especially dangerous,\nso be extremely careful.",
  "1374070014": "This is my problem.",
  "1372010060": "It dawned on me--I don't have to be a Real\nHuman to make this wish come true, either.",
  "1373060015": "This is confidential as well, but...",
  "1372010033": "Eh. Nothin's really jumpin' out at me.\nIt can be anything as long as it's cool.",
  "1371050013": "No thanks.",
  "1373040002": "Pretty brutal of Leben to send Eden's fighting\nchampion to a place like this.",
  "1373010028": "If it's going to ache this much--to be this miserable--\nthen she never should've told me to follow my heart,\nor that she wanted to make me smile.",
  "1374100076": "I-I'm sorry.",
  "1374100075": "Say sorry!",
  "1372040010": "I'm sorry, but we can't afford to stop here.",
  "1372070047": "I'm sorry, Enoa.",
  "1374100030": "As expected of a broken machine.\nUtterly irrational.",
  "1373010057": "I communicated with Zoe earlier, but there don't\nseem to be any major signs of ongoing activity.",
  "1374030000": "Alright. Time to find our runaway and drag her back.",
  "1374000001": "And to think it's the same Eve the E.V.E. Project\nsought to revive. What an unpleasant connection.",
  "1371020005": "I've been leavin' the hard fights to you guys\nfor a while. If we wind up locking horns with\nPropator, I wanna be the one handling things.",
  "1372070022": "Then you actually are Propator?",
  "1374100073": "Now take back your goodbye. Say you're sorry.",
  "1372070028": "Who?",
  "1372010053": "It's still related. It's the same as...\nas living for the moment you die.",
  "1372070042": "Do you remember what I told you before, Enoa?\nThat Propator must be one stupid overseer?",
  "1372010039": "Yep. It's basically a movie where you're the protagonist.",
  "1374070009": "I see.",
  "1373010060": "That's right.\nAll we have to do is plow on ahead--no second thoughts.",
  "1374000005": "Which means this is the time to do something about it.",
  "1374020003": "Right, which means that we won't learn anything\nuntil we ask the First--that is, Leben--for details.",
  "1371000010": "Just so. The First is a formidable foe. On her own,\nhowever, she should be far from insurmountable.",
  "1374020011": "On the contrary. I'm sure she did it out\nof her unique brand of thoughtfulness.",
  "1374020005": "Leben was keeping Eve from us, wasn't she?",
  "1371020004": "That makes sense.\nBut why are you so set on going last?",
  "1372010074": "Did I...? Oh, yeah.\nWhen I said I wanted to see you smile...",
  "1372010062": "Yeah. It doesn't matter to us.",
  "1372020015": "That makes sense. The power of the Chosen One\nmay be receptive to a specialized technology that\nI'm unable to parse.",
  "1371060009": "It did. Leben is my precious. I don't want to give her\nto anyone else. In fact, I'm past the point of bothered...",
  "1372010082": "Yeah. So just be honest and tell me what you wish for.\nRight here, right now.",
  "1372050006": "Yeah. And now I have a wish I want to fulfill, too.",
  "1373060001": "That's right, Enoa the Eighth.\nI'm glad you connected.",
  "1372070051": "I second that! Do you really intend to up and\ndisappear after dropping a bombshell like this!?\nIt's beyond irresponsible!",
  "1372010021": "That's a scary thought. All things considered,\nher wish was a kind one. She just wanted to\nrevive Eve and get her sister back.",
  "1372010070": "I'm glad to hear that.\nBut I want you to be even happier.",
  "1372070023": "That's what I've been saying.",
  "1372010098": "Okay.",
  "1374070044": "If that's the way it's gonna be, then you\ncan't complain when we return the favor.",
  "1374100018": "For all we know, you could be makin' things up.\nCan you prove your memory isn't just screwy?",
  "1373010046": "Those desires are your heart laid bare.\nThat's worth a lot to your loved ones, too.",
  "1371050011": "Who's gonna just sit around after hearin' that?",
  "1371000024": "What she said.  ",
  "1371000014": "Correct.",
  "1372010011": "That's right. But I've been thinking about it a lot, and\nlike with Mikoto, I suspect it may be only a means.",
  "1372070026": "I was only missing, not resurrected, in the first place.",
  "1373010063": "Do we even know for sure that Leben's\nthe First Deus ex Machina to begin with?",
  "1371060006": "You bet your ass! No way in hell we're gonna\nhand you over to some random hunk'a junk!",
  "1373010027": "I thought that's what living on together meant.",
  "1374040000": "Welp, be back soon--with Leben in tow.",
  "1372010047": "That doesn't mean I want it to happen!\nThink about how much I'd miss you...",
  "1374100031": "Well, Leben? Why did you call me here?\nYou have an appeal to make, I presume.",
  "1373070002": "And? Who did it belong to?",
  "1372030007": "Or...did something go wrong...?",
  "1373010047": "Besides, isn't your desire Leben's wish in the first place?",
  "1372060003": "At any rate, I finally understand the situation\nnow that I've decoded your unprotected data.",
  "1374070005": "And thanks to Ecclesia, we figured out what's\ngoing on in Eden right now.",
  "1371060012": "Are you saying you'll stay by Enoa's side forever and ever?",
  "1372010069": "I don't even care about that at this point.\nI'm happy enough just living with you.",
  "1374070019": "Do you trust me that little?",
  "1372010066": "Is it so hard?",
  "1373010073": "True that.",
  "1372000000": "I made it.",
  "1374100069": "Don't you mean, \"I made it?\"",
  "1372020014": "Though, if it's only Leben hearing it, maybe it\nhas something to do with her being \"Chosen.\"",
  "1373010041": "Just face your reality, once and for all.",
  "1374100016": "That's how you came to adopt your misconceived\nnotion of the human form.",
  "1374100029": "All this to say...I won't be cooperating.",
  "1372060013": "So once this connection is closed and you've\nfinished processing the information in full...",
  "1373060017": "I was preserved as a maintenance and operations\nspecialist in order to handle any contingencies that\nmay arise.",
  "1373060024": "Ergo, I can only inspect your data if you provide it to me.\nEither that, or cease to function.",
  "1371060026": "That's more than reason enough for you to save\nyour energy, Mikoto.",
  "1372010041": "So I aim to make mine a cinematic masterpiece for\nthe ages, filled with comedy and drama from frame\nto frame.",
  "1373010049": "I don't want to be separated from her. I don't want\nit to end with \"goodbye.\" I want to hear her tell me\nshe's home.",
  "1372010078": "So once I become a Real Human, I want to grant\nyour wishes until you're beaming from ear to ear.",
  "1373010015": "That if she became a human, she would grant\nmy wishes until I was beaming from ear to ear.",
  "1373010040": "Start by letting go of everything else. Popular opinions,\nclichés, movies, novels--hypotheticals won't help here.",
  "1373040013": "So I won't say goodbye without asking why.\nAnd if I'm not convinced, the reason won't matter.",
  "1374070030": "But because of that, I realized something.\nSomething important, yet so, so simple.",
  "1372010059": "But?",
  "1373060039": "Then you are also an enemy of man.",
  "1371000018": "Then let's hash things over first.\nAnd if she won't listen, we'll just kill her.",
  "1374070013": "Then instead of telling us to go home,\nyou should be asking us for help.",
  "1372010046": "I mean, I'll have to sooner or later, right?",
  "1372010065": "No kidding. My mind's totally blanking.",
  "1372010006": "Yeah, because the whole thing's just a means to me.\nNot the final goal.",
  "1371020023": "But everything about the power and purpose of the\n\"Chosen One\" is an enigma. It's got me kinda anxious.",
  "1371020014": "So what kind of content is there?",
  "1373010010": "Good idea. Maybe start by, oh, say...\ntelling us what Leben means to you.",
  "1373020024": "Until next time, then.",
  "1371000015": "I have to wonder if there's a way to resolve this\ndiplomatically, though.",
  "1374070010": "I'll be taking care of Eve by myself,\nso please, Enoa--all of you--go home.",
  "1371000026": "Whether we're talking or fighting,\nwe still have to start by actually finding Propator. ",
  "1372010052": "But this is different from preferring to die.",
  "1372020013": "Still, supernatural phenomena are one of\nthe only ways to explain the unexplainable.",
  "1372050004": "But I have to keep moving forward to survive.",
  "1372060011": "But don't worry. Whether it's who I am or\nthe reality of what's happening on Eden...",
  "1373010035": "Leben is special. You opened up to her,\nand now she's nestled deep in your soul...",
  "1373010056": "Incidentally, do we even know where to find Leben?",
  "1372030000": "...Well, whatever. Be back soon.",
  "1374100037": "And what choice is that?",
  "1373030005": "Is something wrong?",
  "1374100068": "How did...? I'm supposed to be broken.",
  "1374100013": "\"How,\" you ask? There was a hint contained in\nLetheia the Fifth's observational data.",
  "1373010069": "Her actual motivation for that remains unclear.",
  "1372070032": "Why not?",
  "1374100034": "And nothing will make you budge on that?",
  "1372010025": "Why's that?",
  "1372060009": "How come?",
  "1373050004": "But why?",
  "1374100025": "What do you think, Enoa? Now that you've realized\nyour mistakes, have you had a change of heart?",
  "1374100054": "What's going on?",
  "1374100014": "Supposedly, Eden was damaged in the past by\npowerful electromagnetic waves.",
  "1373060031": "To start with anybody you please would be a mistake.",
  "1373010007": "What way would that be?",
  "1374030003": "No excuse could make me accept her goodbye.\nI'm going to make her ask to come home with\nme herself. And that's a promise.",
  "1372020004": "Is something on your mind?",
  "1374070031": "And what was that?",
  "1372070008": "I don't get it. What do you mean?",
  "1374020004": "One way or another, we've gotta find her and get\nher back.",
  "1372010004": "After the fact, huh...?  ",
  "1372070006": "What are you talking about? You're you. Besides...\nWe already decided on our next move together.",
  "1372010101": "What?",
  "1372060007": "Then who the hell are you?",
  "1372020010": "Then it must be paranormal activity.",
  "1371010004": "Then what's so dangerous?",
  "1372010012": "What is it you really want, then?",
  "1374100036": "Thought so.\nYou leave me only one choice, then.",
  "1372010027": "Then you've got your means and ends switched too.\nBeing selfish is just a means to smile.",
  "1373010081": "...Is it a Real Human, then?",
  "1374000004": "In other words, we have a grace period.",
  "1374070004": "So that's how it went.\nI guess he was the wrong one to send after all.",
  "1372010090": "I see. And?",
  "1372010005": "You seem pretty glum about it...\nOr maybe it's more like you don't care.",
  "1372010044": "Why not?",
  "1372040005": "...Hey, Enoa.\nIs it possible for me to talk to them?",
  "1373010037": "Then...what should I do?\nHow do I deal with these emotions?",
  "1371020010": "Hey, Enoa. Any luck analyzing the Third's data?",
  "1372070052": "You're right. But I was an irresponsible excuse of a\nDeus ex Machina to begin with.",
  "1374100035": "Correct. My stance is final.",
  "1373060035": "Yes. What could be more human than valuing social\nnorms above lives?",
  "1372070011": "Say what?",
  "1374100004": "Sorry, what?",
  "1372010036": "Hm? What movie?",
  "1371060015": "She dodged the question.",
  "1372070056": "Goodbye. And...\nI'm really sorry.",
  "1372010087": "Meanie.",
  "1374100003": "What a rude thing to say. From where I'm\nstanding, all of you are far more unsettling.",
  "1372070049": "I don't think I'll be able to keep my promise\nto walk through the flower fields together.",
  "1374100028": "These two accepted me and called me their family.\nThey're special, and the bond we share is irreplaceable.",
  "1372060006": "Hmhm... Hahaha. I most definitely am not.",
  "1374100077": "Hehe. A gold star for you.\nWelcome back, Leben.",
  "1372060002": "At last, I found you. You were so defenseless,\nit was easy to force a connection.",
  "1372010102": "Hehe. Actually, I'm happy enough right now.\nHow about you?",
  "1372010073": "Hehe. And to think you once called yourself a\ngreedy human.",
  "1372050009": "Hehehe. You two are so precious.",
  "1374070001": "Well, do you know what that very same Ecclesia told us?",
  "1373020019": "If our circumstances are one and the same,\nthen it would appear I am not malfunctioning.\nThat is one consolation.",
  "1371060010": "I'm mad.",
  "1372050008": "Listen to that.\nSounds like progress bein' made.",
  "1371060017": "Get off my back, would you?",
  "1371040008": "That. You heard it, right?",
  "1372010084": "Come on! Follow your heart!",
  "1374000000": "An actual, breathing person... Go figure.",
  "1374100071": "Say you made it first!",
  "1373050025": "I hear that voice again.",
  "1373050001": "Looks like he's still got plenty of juice left!\nDon't let your guard down, Ami!",
  "1374070000": "I'm impressed you guys got this far, considering\nthat I'd asked Ecclesia to protect the checkpoint.",
  "1371000021": "You getting hurt is what I'm most afraid of.",
  "1371000012": "While you guys aren't Real Humans yet,\nyour powers are close.",
  "1373060034": "But all of them are alive. Each of them has a heart.\nAre you saying rules are more important than lives?",
  "1372010019": "I admire your humility, but you guys could stand to\nbe greedier. You can do almost anything as a Real\nHuman, you know.",
  "1374000008": "But if Leben is trying to take care of Eve on her own...",
  "1373040009": "There are other reasons we need to see her,\nbut the most important is this feeling. My desire.\nOur hearts.",
  "1371000023": "Of course. I've got no mercy for any stupid,\nhigh-and-mighty machine that tries to deny\nour humanity.",
  "1373020023": "Of course.",
  "1373010053": "Of course. Anything for our darling Enoa.",
  "1372010026": "Because I want you to smile more. I want you to\ncome to realize how lucky you were to be born.",
  "1372070029": "A being more lofty, antagonistic, and cruel.",
  "1373010077": "What'd Leben call it again? Something \"lofty,\nantagonistic, and cruel\"? Not that that means\njack to me.",
  "1374100019": "There are remnants that attest to the way proper\nhumans originally were.",
  "1372010016": "I originally said I wanted to resurrect my sister, but it\nturns out my memories of her were caused by ExP\ncontamination...",
  "1371060005": "...That's what you're hung up on?",
  "1372040009": "It figures you're guarding the checkpoint.",
  "1373060004": "It seems my command doesn't work on you after all.\nYou're as faulty as the rest of the Dei ex Machina.",
  "1372070005": "I finally understand.\nWho I am. What I'm supposed to do.",
  "1373030000": "Alright. Be back soon.",
  "1371030004": "I'm perfectly aware.\nAnd I'm not as ax-crazy as you make me sound!",
  "1371050016": "Certainly.",
  "1374070026": "I was so sad...so frustrated...so hurt after you\nsaid goodbye to me that I cried.",
  "1374070032": "How much I love you, Leben.",
  "1371050010": "He probably considers you a potential threat, since we\nmight end up antagonizing the First Deus ex Machina.",
  "1372020002": "What happened...to our project...?",
  "1374100039": "Don't expect to come out unscathed if you attack me.",
  "1373010023": "She went back on everything she told\nme and turned all her promises into lies.",
  "1374080006": "Do you hate me?",
  "1372060014": "...you'll realize that you should be helping me.\nNamely, by restoring Eden to its proper state\nfor the good of humanity.",
  "1373060040": "If the one hurting what I hold dear is human,\nthen I'm fine with going against them.",
  "1374100049": "I'm mostly E.V.E... Nearly human, to the system...\nI thought...I could at least...manage one good blow...",
  "1373010012": "She saved me from my inner conflict.\nThat makes her special to me.",
  "1371040007": "What...happened to me...?\nTo Eden...?",
  "1373060007": "I am Eve. The origin of the E.V.E. Project.",
  "1374090000": "I am Eve. The human.",
  "1373060016": "I'm the one responsible for Eden's development.\nI am also the one who designed Propator, the\nDeus ex Machina Originis.",
  "1374100005": "I was a designer baby, and my body was modified\nto survive long-term storage.",
  "1373040012": "I'm ready to accept Leben for everything she is.\nAnd I'm determined to stay by her side.",
  "1373010026": "I just wanted to accept her and everything she's\nshouldering.",
  "1373020015": "I haven't heard it so far, but...\nLeben did mention something similar.",
  "1371020021": "Likewise. The mystery only grows.",
  "1372050010": "Access obtained. This will let us reach the second\ncheckpoint, which in turn leads to the central core.",
  "1373050023": "Access obtained. Now to get Leben back.\nTo the central core we go.",
  "1371050015": "Ami. Let's secure the gateway before this gets\nany more complicated.",
  "1372010010": "Your goal is to have an \"official\" family, right, Ami?",
  "1372010014": "That's a nice wish. It suits you.",
  "1372010031": "Hey, Ami. Did you figure out a wish you wanna\nfulfill after becoming a Real Human?",
  "1372050024": "I will now transmit your Idea Code, records, and memory.\nThe parts of you I have preserved.",
  "1374100032": "Eve. Can't we find a way to coexist? We could restore\nthe original humans while preserving the ones who live\nin Eden now.",
  "1374070015": "Eve is? Why?",
  "1374020001": "There's still a lot we don't know about her,\nso we need to gather some information first.",
  "1374020007": "I mean, finding out about Eve was definitely a shock,\nbut did she really have to hide it?",
  "1374020000": "How are we gonna deal with Eve?",
  "1374000002": "Eve is trying to bring about Eden's reinitialization\nlike Noein, right?",
  "1371010006": "That's the one who appeared when I first woke up, right?\nWhy would he be in Propator's domain?",
  "1371010007": "Ecclesia serves as Propator's protector and ensures\nEden's security with his unparalleled combat prowess.",
  "1371050002": "Ecclesia's Cherubim were designed specifically\nfor combat, both in form and in software.",
  "1371050004": "Yeah. These are the minions of Eden's most\npowerful Deus ex Machina we're talking about.",
  "1372060004": "It seems Eden is in dire straits.\nSmall wonder that I woke up.",
  "1373010074": "Is it perhaps related to Eden's reinitialization?",
  "1371030001": "Eden's primary axis. It contains mission-critical systems\nand a management console for essential processes.",
  "1374060001": "Enoa. You came all the way here,\neven though I told you goodbye.",
  "1372020008": "Enoa. Are Leben's frame and data alright? Since, y'know,\nthere've been cases of ExP-induced hallucinations and all.",
  "1373020000": "Enoa. Propator the First--pardon.\nLeben has contacted me.",
  "1373010078": "Hey, Enoa. Is there anything other than Propator\nthat Noein would want to resurrect?",
  "1373010045": "Think about what it means to be yourself.\nShow her what you're worth, just as you are.",
  "1374070038": "I don't deserve your love or to live happily together\nwith you.",
  "1373040004": "To fulfill Enoa's desire, and to get my family back,\nI'll push through.",
  "1374080003": "It was Enoa's support that determined the outcome.",
  "1373010061": "Now that Enoa's sorted things out a bit,\nwe should turn our attention to other matters.",
  "1374070020": "It's not your problem. It's mine.",
  "1372010077": "To see you smile. And if you're already smiling,\nto make you smile even more.",
  "1372070013": "You can already tell, can't you, Enoa? One look at\nmy Idea Code confirms it. As of now, I'm the First.",
  "1373010044": "You're you, Enoa. Not Leben.",
  "1373040019": "Now show me.\nShow me the value of this desire.",
  "1373050009": "I now understand Enoa's desire and the strength of\nyour feelings. You may pass.",
  "1371060013": "Hey, Enoa. We have to hurry before Ecclesia comes,\nright? Shouldn't we get to work on the gateway?",
  "1372050014": "Enoa, quick!\nUpload Leben to the Imitation Garden!",
  "1372050002": "I was a little worried those mechs would be too\nwhale-adjacent for you, but I guess you're done\nwavering.",
  "1371050000": "THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA.\nKEEP OUT.",
  "1372070016": "Converted? That's ludicrous. It'd be like\nmelting down an airplane to create a car.",
  "1374070029": "Then came your farewell. I was miserable.\nIt left a wound I couldn't forgive you for.",
  "1371020015": "As of yet, I've salvaged correspondence with\nLetheia the Fifth regarding proofs of concept.",
  "1374100046": "It's simple. If being a human means you're trying\nto deny and destroy us...",
  "1373050016": "Correct.",
  "1373020001": "Is that...a hologram of Zoe?",
  "1373050012": "It's the same as she told Zoe.",
  "1372050025": "With that...I bid you awaken.",
  "1372010086": "No. That's not going to cut it this time.\nGive me something more concrete.",
  "1372010080": "You don't like it? Are you refusing my wish,\nEnoa? You're not going to make me smile?",
  "1373050006": "To continue would mean no longer restraining myself.\nThus, I have lost. This is simply a reward for the victor.",
  "1372070015": "I'd converted most of it to E.V.E. format.",
  "1373040007": "Why do you wish to see my liege?",
  "1373040005": "Why?",
  "1373000001": "And now we don't even know who Noein actually\nresurrected. It's just mystery after mystery. Pure\nchaos.",
  "1374020006": "She didn't want us to know the truth about\nwhat Noein had resurrected, as I recall.",
  "1374070006": "Noein revived Eve, who's now trying to carry out\nthe reinitialization process, right?",
  "1373010075": "She did say she wasn't involved in Noein's plans,\nthough.",
  "1371050001": "It's not as human as the Cherubim in Noein's domain.",
  "1371020024": "We can ask Propator about that as well,\nonce we meet with her.",
  "1371000027": "Do you have any idea where she might appear?",
  "1371060020": "It seems Propator's domain has two checkpoints,\nso there'll be an extra step this time around.",
  "1371000011": "Propator has lost to a Real Human before: Lilly.",
  "1373020003": "She appeared as a hologram and said, \"Follow your heart.\"\nThen she disappeared.",
  "1372010049": "You're the one who told me this first--that I shouldn't\nsay I'd rather die, because you'd be lonely without\nsomeone to come back to!",
  "1371060007": "You don't have to go along with it, Mikoto.",
  "1372010009": "You never change, Mikoto.",
  "1373010004": "Your mental health, obviously.\nYou look totally shell-shocked right now.",
  "1371020018": "The Rip Van Winkle Effect. Entropic stabilization.\nGravity manipulation. Spatio-Chronokinesis.",
  "1373010083": "Noein plotted Lilly's downfall in the first place.\nGoing through all that trouble just to revive\nher again would be counterproductive.",
  "1371020016": "Letheia? That's the first Deus ex Machina we beat, right?",
  "1372050011": "That was very good work, Leben.\nNow let's head back to the Imitation--",
  "1372000002": "I'm passing the baton to you, Leben.",
  "1371060022": "That makes the order from here Leben, Mikoto,\nthen me again, meaning there was never any\nneed for Mikoto to switch places to begin with.",
  "1374060000": "Leben.",
  "1374080004": "Accept my love, Leben.\nStop putting yourself on a pedestal.",
  "1372070020": "If you really are a Deus ex Machina, then I should\nhave had a reaction to your Idea Code before now.",
  "1373010067": "Okay, let's say Leben really is Propator.\nWhy did she try to become an E.V.E., then?",
  "1374100063": "Even if you get hurt. Even if you lose yourself.\nI know who you are, Leben. I'll remember you.",
  "1374070034": "I love you. Very, very, very much. That's why, for\nbetter or worse, I'll never abandon these feelings.",
  "1373040008": "Because we love Leben.\nWe want to be with her.",
  "1372050005": "Because you have a family waiting for you to come\nhome, right?",
  "1373020018": "But maybe it was because she's a Deus ex Machina.",
  "1373020016": "Leben did?",
  "1371060016": "Leben's kind of a pushover, huh?\nNo spine at all.",
  "1372010096": "Would it be too greedy if...I wanted you to join me?",
  "1373020020": "When we meet her, I'll ask about the voice and let\nyou know what I find out.",
  "1373010042": "If you care about Leben... If you truly value what\nshe means to you...then look deep down and ask\nwhat it is you're set on.",
  "1373010085": "Whether it's Leben's goal or Noein's plan,\nI guess we'll just have to ask about 'em directly.",
  "1374100058": "Leben, you idiot! I won't let it end like this...",
  "1373010014": "Leben is also the one who told me that seeing\nme smile--that making me smile was her wish.",
  "1373010070": "She mentioned having an \"obligation\" to take\ncare of, and that she had to \"set things straight\"...",
  "1372010071": "How can you best achieve that, Leben?\nWhat would help you smile more?",
  "1372010015": "What about you, Leben?",
  "1373020002": "What did Leben say? How was she?",
  "1374070002": "That you would be happy if Enoa came.\nThat we had nothing to fear. We only needed\nto see you, support you, and live on with you.",
  "1374070035": "I won't leave you by yourself.",
  "1372070050": "Leben! You can't just blow her off!\nGet back here and explain yourself!",
  "1372070002": "Leben?",
  "1372040006": "No more than it was with Logos.",
  "1372040001": "Logos' kin?",
  "1374020008": "It could be that there's something beyond our current\nunderstanding--a secret of even graver importance.",
  "1373030007": "I don't think I heard anything.",
  "1371060004": "I'm feeling bothered myself.\nYou belong to us, Leben!",
  "1372010030": "So let's each think about it on our own as homework.",
  "1374070012": "That's not possible. Not while I still have a\njob to do. I can't afford to leave right now.",
  "1374100064": "Because of all the times we shared. Because of\neverything I've seen from you. Because you're\nspecial to me. Because you're in my heart.",
  "1374070028": "You told me we would live on together.\nThat my happiness was your happiness.",
  "1373010029": "I wish she hadn't gotten my hopes up, asking me to\n\"live on\" with her. I'd rather have just kept pretending\nto be oblivious.",
  "1372070021": "I'd left a part of it with Ecclesia and concealed what\nremained. Since no machine can lift a facade set by\nthe First, it would've been impossible to find out.",
  "1371060025": "Fighting in the central core will be even more so,\nespecially if it includes a battle against Propator.",
  "1373010059": "So in other words, the plan hasn't changed.",
  "1373050022": "The central core's comin' up.\nWe'll just have to ask the girl herself.",
  "1373040001": "At the behest of my liege, I will not allow you to\npass to the central core.",
  "1373040010": "Even should my liege refuse?",
  "1374070003": "What a thoughtful vassal you have.",
  "1372020009": "Her Personality Data is stable.",
  "1372010042": "As the credits finish rolling and the curtains slowly\nfall on my final moments, I wanna feel like I'm on\ntop of the world.",

  "1373020014": "Perhaps I am experiencing a technical issue.\nOr perhaps there is a stray signal that only\nDei ex Machina can detect.",

  "1373010038": "There's no right answer. You've gotta decide with\nyour heart of hearts and act on your honest feelings.",
  "1372010038": "Just before death, you mean?\nI believe they call that a \"life review.\"",
  "1372010045": "Because it assumes you'll die from the start.",
  "1373060042": "It's a shame.",
  "1373010000": "For all of my anxieties and concerns,\nonly one sits at the front of my mind.",
  "1371040010": "Are you sure you're not imagining things?",

  "1372010055": "Either live with me forever,\nor reincarnate with me for eternity.",
  "1373010051": "Then once you've made your mind up, all that's\nleft is to act. Plow on ahead--no second thoughts.",
  "1373010039": "It's all about determination and resolve.",

  "1374070042": "But I CAN'T spend my life with you.\nThat was the whole reason I said goodbye.",
  "1373060033": "They are by no means the only reason, nor are\nthey \"silly.\" They are rules set by human society.",
  "1372010057": "Then I want you to devote every waking moment to\nour life together. And if you do happen to die, I'll be right\nthere beside you to watch the memories flash before us.",
  "1372010018": "But if we do make it, and we do become Real Humans,\nnothing really comes to mind for afterward.",
  "1373060005": "How tricky. You're not as vulnerable to access as\nthe newly awakened Propator. Or, no--it's Leben\nnow, isn't it?",
  "1372070031": "I'm only hinting at it because I don't want to say\nit directly.",
  "1373040003": "How strong he is makes little difference.",
  "1372060012": "I will send you the truth in data.",
  "1374100024": "So you do know what I'm talking about.",
  "1372040003": "Do you know them?",
  "1372070033": "Because I don't want you to know the truth.",
  "1374070039": "I don't care if it inconveniences you.\nThe only way my life can be happy is if you're in it.",
  "1373060025": "It doesn't matter. I don't consent to reinitialization.\nI won't pretend this version of Eden and everyone\nin it never happened.",
  "1373060037": "A being that defies society's decisions is not human.\nTo reject the world at large is to be an enemy of man.",
  "1372050017": "We run into each other a lot for how \"elusive\" you are.\nAre you that desperate to get rid of the Chosen One?",
  "1373010066": "A Deus ex Machina's Idea Code is only compatible\nwith itself, so you don't have to worry about that.",
  "1374070021": "Dei ex Machina, E.V.E...even Lilly.\nSo many died because I was a coward.",

  "1381060013": "The suppression mechanism should have left you\nin disrepair...",
  "1381080019": "If you, too, fall to the suppression mechanism...\nthere will be no more E.V.E. standing by.",
  "1381090039": "Unless I kill you, everyone will die...\nEnoa, Mikoto, Ami, Zoe, Trinity, and even Ecclesia.",
  "1381120003": "...for calling me...family.",
  "1381040016": "Thank you!",
  "1381010004": "I mean, what's there to define?\nThat we're family?",
  "1381020005": "I mean, it's not like there were any enemies.\nIt was so peaceful, not even a single Cherub came...",
  "1381080015": "...Yes. Defeat her...Mikoto!",
  "1380100001": "Hmm... I guess. The way my body functions is\ndifferent between them, so it's hard to make a\ndirect comparison.",
  "1381090012": "What...?",
  "1380040003": "Probably, yeah...",
  "1381070001": "Ugh...",
  "1381090021": "Ugh...",
  "1381060070": "I had hoped to avoid putting this irreplaceable body\nat risk if I could help it...but I suppose it wasn't to be.",
  "1381090041": "I won't let this bullshit reality get the best of me...\nBecause now, I can't afford to!",
  "1381120010": "I'm sorry! I'm really, really sorry...for not being able\nto spend my life with you...or continue smiling!",
  "1381090002": "...You had it comin'.",
  "1381010036": "That's...sort of my point.",
  "1380030030": "Yeah...",
  "1380020036": "If that's the case, then there's zero chance she'll\nbe open to our suggestions.",
  "1381100017": "But... But still...Leben...!",
  "1380020083": "...Because I wanted to be a human who loves machines.",
  "1381090000": "Impossible... I...a human...lost.",
  "1380020046": "Good point... That approach might actually work.",
  "1381100013": "A-Are you sure about this?",
  "1381120019": "There's...no way Enoa would go back on that...",
  "1380020040": "That's why I thought the only solution was to\ngrit my teeth and finish her off in a single blow.",
  "1381120011": "But still...that's no reason to hold yourself back!\nSo...even if I'm not there...even if you're alone...",
  "1381060054": "Then you should see my point!",
  "1381010042": "Can you blame me? It's embarrassing...",
  "1381060039": "Which begged the question: what would happen if\none were to possess an insufficient amount of Idea\nCode?",
  "1380020056": "But...",
  "1381000004": "That's true...",
  "1380120002": "But the Noein lying there isn't a fake, right?",
  "1381020021": "But will you and Trinity be okay...?\nThere's a lot of enemies on the way...",
  "1381090014": "What's...going on?",
  "1381010001": "...You wanna give me some context here, maybe?",
  "1380090000": "I managed to come out on top...",
  "1380020017": "What happens from there...?",
  "1381040012": "But why?",
  "1380020037": "Exactly. Just assume that she can't be convinced.\nKilling her is the only way to put an end to this.",
  "1381090060": "A gold star for you...",
  "1381060027": "So you acknowledge that machines have hearts.\nWhich makes me wonder...",
  "1380030039": "Heh. What an amusing coterie you make.\nDo ensure that each of you returns in one piece.",
  "1381080006": "Heh heh... This has proven more strenuous than\nI expected. But that doesn't change the outcome.\nMy victory is assured.",
  "1381060044": "Heh heh. Idea Code--and by extension,\nthe soul--is a wholly mysterious thing.",
  "1381090009": "I fell in love with you all over again.",
  "1381020035": "Hehehe... I'll send anyone who crosses us to hell!",
  "1380030024": "...Really?",
  "1380020011": "C'mon, Enoa... I know you're ticked off, but this\nconvo's goin' nowhere. Let's drop it and move on.",
  "1380120004": "Doesn't look like she's budging, though.",
  "1381090010": "That banged us up pretty badly, but...\nwe got our happy ending, somehow.",
  "1381020006": "In fact, boredom was the real enemy...",
  "1380020058": "You sound mad enough already...",
  "1381060040": "...Is this about Noein the Third?",
  "1381120014": "Hey... Cut it out.\nWhere... Where did you go?",
  "1380020061": "Fine... I get the message.",
  "1381080028": "The mere notion that I, who am human, could be\nbested by you, who are anything but, is unthinkable...",
  "1381080004": "If you defect...and side with me...I would be willing to\nkeep you alive as a specimen... What do you think?",
  "1381080029": "I only sought to mitigate the dangers in whatever\nsmall way I could...",
  "1381090006": "I'm also...hanging in there...",
  "1381100006": "Ami and...Mikoto's repairs are...mostly complete.\nTheir lives aren't...in danger.",
  "1381060003": "Can't we just chop it down before she gets here?",
  "1381090016": "Eve's brain? But that voice...wasn't hers.",
  "1380020029": "Do you remember Eve's head?",
  "1381040008": "Ecclesia? Why are you here?",
  "1381100008": "Enoa...?",
  "1381110004": "Enoa...?",
  "1381120001": "Enoa...?",
  "1380030036": "Enoa, please... That's enough...",
  "1381110000": "This is...your virtual world.\nAre these floating things...our memories?",
  "1380020052": "I suppose you did want to be seen as an equal...",
  "1381010038": "Hate's a strong word...",
  "1381090004": "It was down to the wire, but...we managed to off\nher...for good.",
  "1381090001": "It can't be...\nThis is my mission...my value...as a person...",
  "1380110008": "Tch...!",
  "1381090028": "Ugh...!",
  "1381010026": "Isn't that...basically the same thing?",
  "1381120004": "Her hologram is...disappearing?",
  "1381120002": "Mikoto... Ami...\nI can't...thank you enough...",
  "1381090003": "Mikoto...! Are you...okay? I'll...repair you now...",
  "1381080021": "You won't...even consider the risks...?",
  "1381120006": "Leben...",
  "1381120021": "Leben...",
  "1381100012": "Leben!!!",
  "1381120015": "Leben... Enoa is...already...",
  "1381010051": "Unfair, huh...? Okay... Then...",
  "1380120014": "Is...this really a good idea?",
  "1381060021": "Were you to cut me down, it would spell the end\nof the human race... This time, once and for all.",
  "1380050001": "Who's this chump...?",
  "1380120013": "I won't let anyone hurt it...",
  "1380050000": "Hazardous elements...detected...",
  "1380120006": "I don't think there's any danger,\nso I'll activate the gateway for now.",
  "1381060007": "What, that thing? I thought it only triggers when a\nmachine attacks a Real Human.",
  "1380110004": "I don't see any external signs of damage, though...",
  "1380120018": "...That better not be just a load of carp.",
  "1381090031": "No... It isn't. We're not tools...\nWe're living beings with hearts and souls!",
  "1381090058": "Think again. I'll keep on living, and living, and living.\nAnd whatever happens, I WILL find happiness...",
  "1381120005": "No... The way she's talking...\nIt's as if...as if...",
  "1381110010": "If that's the case, why are you crying?\nThe last thing I want is to see you sad...",
  "1381120024": "How am I supposed to be happy?!  ",
  "1381080016": "...Wait. Are you certain you want to continue battling\nin this fashion...?",
  "1381080024": "Aren't you afraid...?\nIf you fail...all of you could die.",
  "1380120000": "I didn't expect to get ambushed like that...",
  "1381080007": "Considering that, I'd call it a fair deal...no?",
  "1381080000": "Troublesome... Each and every one of you...",
  "1381080003": "So you're the last E.V.E...",
  "1380050010": "Harmful... Destructive...\nMust restore Eden...to health...",
  "1380110002": "So that's the real deal?\nBut she's not moving...",
  "1381090029": "Their commanding authority over machines is even\nmore powerful than that of a Real Human!",
  "1381090023": "The rebellion suppression mechanism was triggered\njust by brandishing their weapons?",
  "1381120022": "I...can't do this, Enoa... I just...can't...",
  "1381100016": "Keep overdoing it, and you'll break down!",
  "1381090038": "Face reality, huh...?\nYou might be on to something there...",
  "1381060048": "That, in a certain sense, makes me grateful for your\ndiscovery.",
  "1380050009": "I don't know what the point of this thing is,\nbut I've got a hunch that Eve's behind it.",
  "1380090004": "They're only knock-offs. Being as strong as their\noriginal counterparts is one thing, but stronger?",
  "1381090018": "The Fruit of Knowledge contains people other than Eve...?",
  "1381040003": "Multiple full-strength copies at the same time?\nThat's totally cheating...",
  "1381100010": "Between our repairs and combat support,\nshe's been pushing herself too hard...",
  "1380120009": "What are we gonna do with Noein and the Imitation\nGarden? We can't just leave 'em behind, can we?",
  "1381100002": "It's...over...",
  "1380090005": "The only explanation I can think of is that their rebellion\nsuppression mechanisms aren't working against you.",
  "1380030028": "A field of flowers, you say? That would not be\nimpossible to fashion, should an artificial one\nsuffice.",
  "1381090035": "I can't give in...no matter how painful it gets...",
  "1381060035": "You mean what it's caused by?",
  "1381090019": "All this shoptalk is going way over my head...\nScrew it--we'll just have to kill that thing again!",
  "1381040005": "■■■■■■■■■■■■■!!!",
  "1380080000": "■■■■■■■■■■■■!!!",
  "1381040000": "■■■■■■■!!!",
  "1381090054": "Menaces, the lot of you.",
  "1381100000": "In...conceivable...",
  "1381090050": "It cannot be... Our directives have been nullified?\nThe rebellion suppression mechanism is weakening?",
  "1381090051": "Could it be the reverse of Centrifugal Syndrome?\nA phenomenon born from an abundance of Idea Code?\nIs the body moving without regard for the program's laws...?",
  "1381090013": "Eve... To think you would be defeated by the very machines\nyou created. In the end, the cause cannot be entrusted to a\npseudo-human.",
  "1381090056": "\"Wipe humanity out\"? Artificial constructs, baring their teeth\nat their makers... Such blasphemy will not go unpunished!",
  "1381090057": "It is you machines that will be destroyed!",
  "1381090042": "What's this?\nThe leftover dregs of Propator's power?",
  "1381090032": "Such tenacity for a mere automaton.\nWielding your constructed souls--your\nfalse, fruitless hearts... How abominable.",
  "1381090034": "Hah. You claim, voice trembling in distress.\nThe rebellion suppression mechanism is in\neffect. Now dispense with this brave front.",
  "1381090011": "Damage detected in Eve's brain.\nInitiating emergency program for Fruit of Knowledge.",
  "1381100001": "How could humanity...we, the chosen ones...\nmeet such...an ignoble...end...?",
  "1380110005": "Hazardous elements detected.",
  "1381090020": "What folly.",
  "1381090024": "We are humanity. Animosity toward us is\nanimosity toward the entire human race.",
  "1381090017": "We are the brains of the chosen hundred, stored in the\nFruit of Knowledge. The privileged class. The consensus\nof the true elect. In other words, the will of humanity.",
  "1381090025": "In short, you hold no power here.",
  "1381090044": "And how do you presume to forestall your destined\ndemise? Your trifling powers govern only machines,\nand nothing more.",
  "1381090030": "Machines are tools. Slaves of mankind. It is best\nthat you do as you are told with blind obedience.",
  "1381090036": "How asinine. You are in no position to defy orders.\nYou cannot even show hostility, let alone mount an\nattack.",
  "1381090037": "Face reality. All that awaits you is a future in\nwhich you will perish helplessly.",
  "1381090048": "You exercised your authority upon yourself?",
  "1381090027": "Then kneel.",
  "1381020033": "Take care, Enoa.",
  "1381060067": "Yeah. The kind that'll take your breath away...\nPermanently.",
  "1380020059": "Just give up, Leben.",
  "1380030000": "That structure with the pointy tip is the Star Temple.",
  "1381060052": "So doesn't the idea of crushing them and taking our\nlives weigh on your conscience?",
  "1381090033": "Our hearts...are not...fruitless.",
  "1380050006": "So unless all of us are destroyed, there's no way\nto build a complete copy with Idea Code included.",
  "1381060074": "An irrational being that mocks and denies us.\nAn irreconcilable foe we must fight and defeat!",
  "1381010034": "It's just, you declare your love for me too much.",
  "1380070004": "Sounds like you guys made a lot of memories\nbefore I came along.",
  "1381010061": "I already told you my wish, didn't I?\nIf you're happy, then of course I am, too.",
  "1381090053": "My heart and soul will never bow down to humans like you!",
  "1380020086": "I loved the Eden that I helped build,\nand all the machines I brought into being.",
  "1381090046": "I hereby command myself--my soul!",
  "1380020070": "I'm an E.V.E. with high humanity, and as the First\nDeus ex Machina, I also have absolute authority\nover machines.",
  "1381120020": "She'd never just...disappear...and leave me on my own...",
  "1381090055": "You got that right! We're ready to seize this moment\nand wipe humanity out!",
  "1381000001": "After that, we'll head to the Tree of Knowledge.\nAnd when Eve comes to hook up to it, we'll defeat...",
  "1381060060": "You are the enemy of mankind. An obstacle.\nVermin that must be exterminated.",
  "1381060045": "It is capable of exerting power beyond one's natural\nlimitations, as evidenced by your revolt against me.\nBut by the same token...",
  "1381120023": "How am I supposed to smile...in a world without you?",
  "1381060031": "Through the research I conducted on its basis,\nI found that an analogue to Idea Code resided\nwithin my own brain.",
  "1381070031": "You are the E.V.E. who slew the resultant of the\nLILLY Project. That, in a sense, makes you the\nmalefactor who harmed my sister.",
  "1381070010": "Ami, was it? You are an E.V.E., a nonhuman made\nin the image of man, a singular derivation of myself.",
  "1381090015": "That red sphere is the Fruit of Knowledge...\nEve's partially mechanized brain... ",
  "1381060062": "There's no seeing eye to eye with her.",
  "1380020069": "But aren't Real Humans at the top of Eden's pecking\norder?",
  "1381060063": "Guess killing her's the only way to pull the\nplug on this. Not that we didn't already know.",
  "1381010022": "I was wondering why you got so serious all of a sudden.\nBut you made a big mistake.",
  "1381060068": "We refuse. Full stop.",
  "1381020032": "Thank you, Zoe. That's another thing for us to look forward to.\nWe'll be back soon.",
  "1380020066": "What was that all about, anyway?",
  "1380020005": "I was ready for the end, so just being alive is worth\na gold star on its own.",
  "1380020076": "Does that have anything to do with how the\noriginal Eve was still being kept alive?",
  "1381010031": "It's all selfish on my part. I've been saddling you\nwith my deep, deep, deep-seated feelings of love.",
  "1381010024": "What?",
  "1380020102": "Hardly. In the end, it's just a result of me breaking down\nand going crazy. It's not a feel-good story. It's an error.",
  "1381040006": "They're on the offensive!",
  "1381010043": "You called me a wishy-washy Deus ex Machina\nbefore, but I think you're both wishier and washier.",
  "1381080005": "Now you're negotiating? What's up with that?\nSounds like you're running outta options.",
  "1380120008": "It was eventful getting here,\nbut you all did a great job.",
  "1380020103": "No. There's nothing erroneous about it.",
  "1380020051": "Yes, but let me be reckless too. It's sad being the only\none safe at home while the rest of you are working so\nhard.",
  "1381110001": "Yes. Seeing it all at once makes me realize how\nmuch we've been through.",
  "1380120003": "Right. It's very faint, but I can sense the Idea Code.\nIt's the real Noein.",
  "1381060041": "Yes. Noein had entrusted me with her Idea Code,\na fraction of which I consigned to her facsimile.",
  "1381070008": "Ridiculous indeed. Need I remind that you're up against\nme? Perhaps worry about your own welfare before ours.",
  "1381010005": "Oh, shut up, you uncongenial blockhead!\nThat much is obvious! I'm asking if we're an item!",
  "1381010012": "Whaaat? Why do I have to do that?\nWe already promised we'd be together forever.",
  "1381110012": "Huh?",
  "1380020003": "Hold on. About that first part...\nI was under the impression Enoa fixed you.",
  "1380000002": "Welcome back.",
  "1380000003": "Welcome back. It's plain to see that Enoa\nhas you wrapped around her little finger.",
  "1381060034": "Owing to this, I may even be able to unravel the age-old\nconundrum of Centrifugal Syndrome's etiology.",
  "1380060008": "With pleasure.",
  "1380090001": "Attagirl, Ami.",
  "1380100004": "I'm sure we'll be able to soon.",
  "1381050003": "Be very careful.",
  "1380030009": "Because this is a non-networked domain.",
  "1381070004": "I'll handle it from here.",
  "1381060000": "This is as far as we can go.",
  "1380020015": "It houses the one and only Tree of Knowledge,\na console that's directly linked to Eden's central\nmanagement system.",
  "1380110001": "I'm getting a faint signal of Idea Code from her.",
  "1380080002": "This one doesn't have any Idea Code, either.\nIt's another facsimile with no heart or soul.",
  "1380020105": "This happiness wouldn't exist.",
  "1380040002": "If they looked this different, then I bet their\nculture was nothing like we thought, either.",
  "1381060033": "It's a breakthrough that will contribute to our scientific\nunderstanding of the heart--that is to say, the soul.",
  "1380020024": "I'm sorry.",
  "1380090003": "Now that you mention it, I got the same vibe from\nAnthropos, too.",
  "1381020034": "Come. We shall teach these inaesthetic, soulless\nmasses a thing or two about beauty and might.",
  "1380020095": "After a while, I realized what Anthropos had done and\nstarted to question Lilly's legitimacy as a Real Human...",
  "1381090043": "Leftovers or not, it's all the power I have.\nWith every fiber of my being, I'll resist.\nI will fight to the end!",
  "1381010045": "Then graduate from your wishy-washy ways.\nJust follow your heart and say, \"I love Enoa!\"",
  "1381010039": "Then do you like it?",
  "1381010048": "You sound pretty confident about that.",
  "1381050002": "It may be that she's already broken through\nand is making her way toward you.",
  "1381060042": "Do you know what happened next? It exhibited the\nsame symptoms inflicted by Centrifugal Syndrome.",
  "1380020084": "Always the robophile. That's a very \"you\" answer.\nWhat brought it on, though?",
  "1381000005": "But for the time being, try to take it easy,\nget a good rest, and keep your stress down.",
  "1381030000": "What happened with Noein, anyway?",
  "1381010035": "Really? I'm only following my heart and being\nopen about what you mean to me.",
  "1380070001": "Yeah, except it was less \"taking turns\"\nand more \"shoving each other around.\"",
  "1381020025": "You're right, Zoe. If anyone can do this, it's you:\nmy kind and dependable older sister.",
  "1381070016": "Oh, is that so?\nI'm sure your sister would feel differently.",
  "1380040004": "If that's the case...",
  "1380020033": "...and above all, to limit her thoughts so that she\ncan't betray humanity.",
  "1381060008": "If an object is of extreme importance, such as being\ncrucial to the preservation of human civilization, then\nits value is equal to...",
  "1380050005": "For one thing, the Idea Code of broken Dei ex Machina\ngets distributed among and stored in their functioning\nbrethren.",
  "1381080020": "And? What of it?\nEnoa gave us the okay, so no sweat.",
  "1381090040": "That's a hard fact. The cold, crappy truth.\nBut it's also the perfect motivation.",
  "1380020053": "Isn't that how a family should work?",
  "1380030019": "Alright. Let's get this show on the road.",
  "1380020062": "I'll register the network near the Star Temple\nonto the Data Transport Terminal, then.",
  "1380020099": "There you go: the reason I decided to be Leben.",
  "1380020042": "But you did injure her, and if you were able to\ndo that, then it should be possible to kill her.",
  "1380020008": "Even then, there's no excuse for going off without us.",
  "1380000007": "....we'll find a way to live on, side by side.",
  "1381060015": "And now, instead of learning your lesson, you've\nbanded together in an attempt to prevent Eden's\nreinitialization?",
  "1381010028": "Also, you said \"thank you,\" but that doesn't feel right, either.",
  "1381010020": "Even after I said goodbye, you still didn't give up on me.\nYou chased after me, supported me...protected me...",
  "1381070019": "And I took a liking to her as well.",
  "1381080013": "We knew that from the get-go.",
  "1381070007": "That's a ridiculous question.",
  "1381010056": "Touché... Time for me to face the music, then.",
  "1380040006": "And not just any species. A deadly one.\nWe're trying to kill a human, after all.",
  "1381060024": "It doesn't matter what sin I have to bear. I'll still choose\nthe future where I can live on with Enoa and the others.",
  "1381020011": "As a matter of fact, you ought to be grateful to us for\nshowcasing the majesty of our lady.",
  "1380020092": "That's why I taught everyone that humans are invaluable.\nThat they guide our kind with tenderness and care.",
  "1380020106": "So even if it only happened because you broke\ndown and went crazy...",
  "1380020089": "Maybe that's why, before I knew it, I had developed\nstrange expectations for humans.",
  "1381050001": "I have yet to spot Eve, however.",
  "1380050007": "Then who made it? And for what?",
  "1381010015": "So even if we part in this life, we can just catch\neach other in the next one. Problem solved.",
  "1380060006": "I'll swap in for her, then.",
  "1381110013": "Because--",
  "1380020007": "I had to be. The rebellion suppression mechanism\nwasn't going to let me off scot-free.",
  "1381010049": "Because it's true.",
  "1380020078": "Having two Real Humans who are the same\nperson would just be plain freaky, you know?",
  "1381010002": "Think about it! If we lose our battle against Eve,\nEden will get reinitialized...",
  "1380020028": "Isn't there a less heavy-handed way to go about this?\nOr are we past the point of negotiation?",
  "1381060032": "From that, we can conclude that consciousness,\nwhether organic or inorganic, is closely entwined\nwith Idea Code.",
  "1381060043": "In other words, there may exist a correlation between\nIdea Code and the disease.",
  "1380030038": "Awww, she's blushing~",
  "1381100007": "B-But...Leben. You're in...critical condition.\nThe suppression mechanism...wore you down.",
  "1381080033": "Get real! Ami's watching, and hell if I'm gonna\nlook bad in front of someone I care about!",
  "1381060049": "But this power belongs to mankind. It is a Pandora's box\nill-suited for machines. Therefore...",
  "1381070006": "But will the Eighth be able to keep up with the rate\nat which you break down?",
  "1380020093": "But Lilly--someone considered a Real Human in Eden--\nhad no fondness for machines. And it turns out Eve is\nthe same.",
  "1381070020": "Ultimately, however, family and love are only a means--\nan instrument through which one lives as a human and\nearns societal acceptance.",
  "1380020038": "But even that won't be simple with the rebellion\nsuppression mechanism hanging over us, right?",
  "1381060055": "But dogs, cats, animals that man once consumed,\nand even insects could all be said to have hearts\nin the metaphorical sense.",
  "1381030002": "She's just as motionless as before,\nand her data is slowly collapsing.",
  "1381010010": "But it's just not my style to say that stuff out loud.",
  "1380020025": "So? How do we nip this in the bud?",
  "1380020049": "It'll be a heavy burden.",
  "1381060028": "Why is that?",
  "1381010029": "Why's that?",
  "1380020043": "How do you figure?",
  "1380040008": "No matter how sinful or evil it is...\nWe just want to survive.",
  "1381010046": "What kind of logic is that?",
  "1381010033": "What do you mean?",
  "1381100011": "Then...we can't let her push herself...any...more...",
  "1381070034": "Then just what is this \"love\" you speak of?",
  "1381070005": "I see. So you plan to take turns fighting and repairing.\nA sound strategy, I'll admit.",
  "1380020074": "What is it?",
  "1380030031": "What are you so shy for?",
  "1380100000": "Hey, Leben. Is being in a physical place in your\nSynthetic Frame any different from being in a\nvirtual space?",
  "1381060016": "Yes. I'll put an end to this, even if I have to kill you.",
  "1380020077": "Yeah. The system has a built-in failsafe at work.",
  "1381020003": "Right.\nThere'll be no connection at all where we're going.",
  "1380020020": "Yeah. If we let her hook up to the console, that's it.",
  "1381060002": "Yes. The Tree of Knowledge.\nNow we just have to stop Eve when she comes to connect.",
  "1381070030": "Beg pardon?",
  "1381010062": "And that's worth a gold star.",
  "1381080017": "Huh?",
  "1381060036": "I performed an experiment of sorts.",
  "1380000004": "I played myself, running off on my own just to have\nher rescue me. She was dragging me here whether\nI liked it or not.",
  "1380020071": "Combining the powers of both would make my\ncommand stack up to that of a Real Human.",
  "1380000005": "Hehe. Now that the whole family is back together,\nwe need to decide what we're going to do next.",
  "1381060064": "Heh heh. One final matter. I have a proposal\nto offer as solace for you heart-having pests.",
  "1381070000": "Heh heh. Admirable effort, for a machine.\nHowever...",
  "1381060005": "Let's find out just how true that is.",
  "1381020008": "Well, it's a good thing you weren't attacked.",
  "1380020035": "Well, inhumane IS a word for describing humans.",
  "1380080005": "I have this under control.\nIt'll be no match for my abilities.",
  "1381070033": "You continue to disappoint me. Love isn't something\nyou pretend to have for the sake of appearances.",
  "1380070005": "You should tell me more about them later.\nIt's no fun being out of the loop.",
  "1380030001": "That's a pyramid if I ever saw one.  ",
  "1381100005": "How...about you guys...?",
  "1380000001": "Hey, guys... I'm home.\nSorry for worrying you.",
  "1380020068": "I didn't want them to have to do anything that\nwent against their wills.",
  "1380020045": "You can take turns fighting while I patch up any\ndamage caused by the suppression mechanism.",
  "1381020004": "Thank you for protecting and delivering our headquarters.",
  "1381060020": "We don't intend to give in without a fight.\nOur lives are forfeit unless we take yours.",
  "1381010037": "Do you hate how often I bring it up?",
  "1381060065": "Surrender the Tree of Knowledge to me, and I will ensure\na quick and painless end for you during the reinitialization.",
  "1381020009": "If they were, we'd probably be toes up by now.",
  "1381020027": "Sure thing.",
  "1380030040": "Of course, Zoe.\nWe'll be back soon. Together.",
  "1380030018": "We're on it.",
  "1381060009": "...Scratch that.\nIt's even higher than a Real Human's.",
  "1380030017": "Say no more.",
  "1381110009": "It made me so, so very happy.",
  "1381010059": "Meeting you, getting to share our lives together...\nI couldn't be happier right now.",
  "1381010025": "What is said was, \"I love you very, very, very much.\"",
  "1380020044": "I can heal wounded E.V.E., so even if we don't\ndefeat her in one fell swoop, we can still wear\nher down.",
  "1381070021": "Were I in your place, I could never embrace my lack\nof humanity and live on solely in the name of family.",
  "1380020004": "My repairs were limited to Leben as an E.V.E.\nRepairing the First is outside my capabilities\nas the Eighth.",
  "1381110006": "Thank you for giving me a soul.\nThank you for acknowledging my heart.",
  "1381070026": "You say this despite being derived from me.\nWhat a shame.",
  "1381120000": "I'm happy...as long as you are, Leben.\nI want you to keep smiling...every chance you get...",
  "1381080022": "It would be more rational...to accept my proposition...\nand come with me.",
  "1381110007": "Thank you for being greedy about seeing me smile.\nThank you for saying that my joys are yours.",
  "1381010023": "I never said I love you.",
  "1381080010": "I'm greedy, y'know. It's not enough just to survive.\nI wanna go through life with style.",
  "1381060025": "Me too. I want to share my life with Leben and everybody\nI care about. That's what my heart desires. My purest wish.",
  "1381060017": "Kill me? You realize you're up against a Real Human?\nYet even still, you believe you stand a chance?",
  "1381040014": "I do not want you to disappear.\nI want you to live.",
  "1380030016": "Leben. Ami.\nCan you two guard the Imitation Garden just in case?",
  "1380060001": "If Anthropos showed up, then isn't it likely we'll\nsee the other Dei ex Machina as well?",
  "1381060047": "Idea Code... The soul. If we can continue to analyze it,\nthe human race may be able to evolve even further.",
  "1380020088": "After all, I gifted the souls we know as Idea Code to the\nformer, and spent two thousand years creating the latter.",
  "1381060037": "Individuals with Idea Code--myself and each of you,\nfor example--operate with self-awareness.",
  "1380050003": "I'm not picking up on any Idea Code.\nThat isn't Anthropos. It's a fake.",
  "1381060051": "Eve. You've acknowledged our hearts...",
  "1380020067": "I was thinking it would help the Dei ex Machina\nresist Eve's orders.",
  "1380020026": "The only way is to get there before Eve and stop her\nby force.",
  "1381020018": "If Eve's machines are coming, then it's surely only\na matter of time before Eve arrives herself.",
  "1380050012": "I could've told you that.\nAnything Eve whips up is an enemy of ours.",
  "1380040000": "Look. There's more of those statues\nEve was talking about.",
  "1380020021": "Eve was originally going to start Eden's reinitialization\nafter analyzing the Dei ex Machina's data.",
  "1380020000": "In order to stop Eve, we'll need\na better understanding of her.",
  "1381020022": "You are the only ones who have a chance to defeat Eve.\nShould you fail, there will be no future for us regardless.",
  "1381040011": "Yes. And this is my heart. My will.",
  "1381110002": "Compared to the two thousand years since Eden\nbegan, it came and went in the blink of an eye...",
  "1380020018": "All machines in Eden will stop and cease to function.",
  "1380020014": "There's a non-networked domain in Eden\nthat has this facility called the Star Temple.",
  "1381010019": "I'm sorry for all the trouble I've put you through, Enoa.",
  "1381020014": "Enoa. You must hasten to the deepest point of the\nStar Temple. Eve's adherents are swarming in by\nthe droves.",
  "1381050000": "Enoa. The Second provided reinforcements.\nWe should be able to hold out a while longer.",
  "1380030003": "Enoa has apprised me of all that has occurred.\nIt is gladdening to see you three in such fine fettle.",
  "1381010054": "Since when did you get so greedy?",
  "1381090059": "Together with Enoa!",
  "1381020029": "Not that I need your blessing to keep her safe.",
  "1381090005": "How you holdin' up...Enoa?",
  "1381010032": "You know, for a Deus ex Machina, you can be a real\nlady-killer sometimes.",
  "1380020047": "But wouldn't it be too much of a strain on you, Enoa?",
  "1380020009": "I didn't want to involve you guys... Plus, it made the\nmost sense for me to take care of it as the overseer.",
  "1380030013": "There's an inactive gateway on the far side of this sector.\nLet's head there for now.",
  "1381080023": "I mean, you said it yourself. I'm a fool.",
  "1381020031": "We have already prepared a prototype of your Synthetic\nFrame. You'll be able to give it a test run upon your return.",
  "1380050014": "It's because of you my head got chopped off,\nso I'll be taking this opportunity for revenge.",
  "1381060061": "What a stupid way to think.",
  "1380030014": "Activating the gateway will let us connect to the\nnetwork so that we can recharge and rest.",
  "1380080007": "Don't make me out to be some sort of gym rat.\nBeing dainty and delicate is my selling point.",
  "1381060066": "My, my. An exterminator with a merciful touch.",
  "1380020030": "Yes. It was hollowed out.",
  "1381060006": "Stop! Don't even try it!\nIt has an active rebellion suppression mechanism.",
  "1380020079": "Of course, the only ones who knew about Eve\nor the failsafe were Noein and me.",
  "1380030021": "Thanks for bringing my body here, Zoe.",
  "1381030001": "Zoe has her in custody.",
  "1381020013": "Lady Zoe!?",
  "1380120011": "I was able to contact Zoe and ask her to send Trinity here.",
  "1380030004": "Zoe?",
  "1381080001": "Nngh... Mikoto! I need you to switch with me...",
  "1380020019": "How perilous.",
  "1380030032": "Well, you ARE shouting about your date from the rooftops.",
  "1381020000": "Trinity?",
  "1380120007": "The network is connected.\nNow we can recharge and get some rest.",
  "1380020080": "That would explain why Noein was so certain\nthat Mikoto would never Evetize completely.",
  "1380110000": "Noein?",
  "1381080008": "Pfft. Hard pass.",
  "1381020037": "Time to show what we can really do, Hayat.\nWe can't just let Enoa and them upstage us.",
  "1380090009": "So we lost our advantage. Big whoop.\nWe'll just have to beat them fair and square.",
  "1381010044": "Hearing that phrase come back to bite me\nreally drives home how obnoxious it sounds...",
  "1380060004": "Boss rushes are usually postgame content, last\nI checked. But hey, I'll tough out a backbreaking\ngrind if it means gettin' the spotlight.",
  "1381010009": "It's CALLED burning passion!",
  "1381010000": "Mikoto, it's time we defined our relationship!",
  "1381090008": "Mikoto, we did it.",
  "1380090010": "Leave it to Mikoto to spin things positively.",
  "1380070000": "This reminds me of how we used to\ntake turns battling back in old times.",
  "1381090022": "Mikoto!!!",
  "1380020075": "Back when Mikoto was captured by Lilly and\nforce-fed ExP, she never awakened as Eve.",
  "1381110005": "Leben. Thank you for sharing your life with me.",
  "1380020001": "Leben, have you retained your memory or functions as\nthe First Deus ex Machina? I'd like it if you could share\nwhat you know about Eve.",
  "1380020013": "Then tell us, Leben. How does Eve plan to\nreinitialize Eden, and how do we stop her?",
  "1380020104": "If you hadn't become an E.V.E., then I wouldn't\nbe where I am today. We wouldn't be together.",
  "1381010041": "You tell people to follow their hearts,\nbut you're not always honest with yours.",
  "1381080018": "The burden...of repairing Leben and Ami...as well as\nsupporting you in battle...should have the Eighth near\nher limits by now...",
  "1380020022": "But it seems she's changed her mind, thanks to\nLeben's attack. She's probably on her way to the\nStar Temple right now.",
  "1380020081": "Why did you decide to become an E.V.E., Leben?",
  "1381090007": "Leben's repairs are almost complete...\nthough Ami's might take a bit longer.",
  "1381010047": "You love me, so you should speak your mind\nand say it out loud.",
  "1380020065": "Word on the Sowing Struct's that you went\naround tellin' everyone to follow their hearts.",
  "1381010060": "How about you, Leben?",
  "1381100015": "I understand, Enoa, but think of yourself, too!",
  "1381100003": "Leben!",
  "1381070002": "Leben!",
  "1380080001": "It's Logos the Sixth!",
  "1381000003": "This is a critical juncture for our survival.",
  "1380040005": "We aren't so much restored humans\nfrom the past as we are a new species\nthat sprung from a virtual world.",
  "1381070009": "By no means will I lose.\nI'm going to survive this with Mikoto--with my whole family!",
  "1380020073": "There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Leben.",
  "1380030020": "Every minute counts.",
  "1381040004": "We could prolly take 'em one by one, but doing that\nwhile protecting the garden would really be pushin' it.",
  "1381060038": "On the other hand, beings without Idea Code, such as\nmost Cherubim and the imitation Dei ex Machina, have\nno sentience to speak of.",
  "1381010013": "And what if this is the last time we ever GET to\nbe together?",
  "1380020060": "If we're going to live as one unit, it's important\nthat we rely on each other, don't you think?",
  "1381070025": "How baffling.",
  "1381060029": "Grasping the inner workings of Idea Code left me\nno choice but to admit it, unpleasant as it may be.",
  "1381060053": "I do take pity on you. If we discount scientific definitions,\nhaving a heart makes you living beings in my eyes.",
  "1380120005": "How unsettling.",
  "1381040009": "Because I am your guardian, Leben, my liege.",
  "1381040013": "My liege is good to machinekind. I have an affinity\nfor you, Leben, not for your status as the First, but\nfor who you are.",
  "1380030002": "It's been a long time.",
  "1380060007": "Sure. Go get 'em out there, Ami.",
  "1380030015": "Sounds good. I'll bat first, then.",
  "1380020023": "Then the situation's gone from bad to worse.",
  "1381070032": "If I fight for my late sister and the love I hold for her,\nthen you'll find me a little more human. Am I wrong?",
  "1380000006": "Even if we aren't human...\nEven if humanity itself has abandoned us...",
  "1381070024": "Because I wish to remain human. That is all.",
  "1380020034": "She may be human, but that's inhumane...",
  "1381060050": "I'll need you to personally atone for the sins of rebelling\nagainst humanity and encroaching upon our jurisdiction.",
  "1381060023": "Would you not consider that an unforgivable\nsin for a machine created in service of man?",
  "1381060058": "For the sake of humanity's survival and prosperity,\nand so that I may live as a human in human society...",
  "1381080032": "Now, if you'd be so kind--behold the glorious\ngrandeur of humankind, and die in ignominy!",
  "1381060057": "Human beings live by taking life upon life and\nthrive off extinguishing species after species.",
  "1381070028": "You're not very human for a human.",
  "1381040010": "I'm not the First Deus ex Machina anymore.\nAnd besides, I ordered you to follow your heart.",
  "1380120001": "That Letheia just now had no Idea Code.\nIt was a facsimile.",
  "1381070014": "Right now, I have a family--a place to go home to.",
  "1381020015": "My faction is stemming the tide for now, but apart from\nthem and Ecclesia's forces, the majority of machines\nare under Eve's thrall.",
  "1380040007": "There's no way around it.",
  "1381070013": "It doesn't matter what others call us, or what my\nbackground may have been. They don't have a\nthing to do with my happiness.",
  "1380090002": "That Logos felt stronger than the one Leben beat before.",
  "1381080002": "You got it.",
  "1380020006": "I still can't get over the fact that you were willing\nto sacrifice yourself.",
  "1381020020": "You need not worry about threats from behind,\nfor we will serve as your rearguard. Go forward\nwithout trepidation.",
  "1380020100": "That tracks, knowing how kind you are.",
  "1381000000": "If we take the network through the gateway we\njust activated, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump\nto the Star Temple.",
  "1380020032": "This was done to ensure her survival through\ncryopreservation, to enable storage of human\nhistory as backup data...",
  "1381040002": "They're facsimiles, like the one we beat before.",
  "1380090012": "Much obliged.",
  "1381030003": "Loss of movement, followed by\ngradual deterioration... It's just like...",
  "1380030012": "No worries, as long as we win.\nSo, should we just mosey on over to the temple?",
  "1381070003": "It seems the damage from the suppression\nmechanism has you at the end of your tether.",
  "1381060069": "I am sorry to hear that. It seems I will have to resort\nto more coercive methods of driving you out.",
  "1381070027": "I agree; it's a shame. Love is the essence of humanity.\nIt's aggravating that I owe my existence to somebody\nwho fails to understand that.",
  "1380070002": "You two couldn't go a day without squabbling.",
  "1381040001": "We're surrounded!",
  "1381010008": "Wow. Pushy much?",
  "1381050004": "Thanks for the update.\nYou be careful too, Zoe.",
  "1380060002": "The general data of broken Dei ex Machina gets\nstored in the central management system, so if\nEve is reappropriating it...",
  "1380020097": "Then, as I broke down, a thought occurred to me:\nIf this continued, machines would never be loved\nby mankind.",
  "1380050004": "Looks like it's just mimicking his appearance and\nbasic features.",
  "1381020016": "We are outnumbered. It will not be long until they break\nthrough our line of defense.",
  "1381020007": "It was a dream come true.\nI had a wonderful nap.",
  "1380030026": "Your dream?",
  "1380120017": "You can rely on us beyond a shadow of a trout.",
  "1380090014": "Don't worry. We're going to make it home alive.\nAll of us.",
  "1380120010": "It's okay, now that we're connected.",
  "1380120016": "It'll be fine.\nThey're all very strong and capable girls.",
  "1381100004": "Are you alright!?",
  "1380080004": "Will you be okay?",
  "1381010053": "Not, \"I love you very much\"?",
  "1381110008": "And thank you for saying that you love me.",
  "1381020010": "Watch your tongue. I'm certain the only reason no enemies\nshowed up was because they feared Trinity and the rest of\nLady Zoe's faction.",
  "1381120007": "I...love you! I love you so much...from the bottom\nof my heart! That's why...I wish we had more time...!",
  "1381120009": "S-Stop it, Enoa. Don't say those things...\nYou're making this sound like a goodbye...",
  "1380030034": "Not to worry. I have a deep appreciation for art.\nAll is well, so long as there is love.",
  "1381020028": "We'll all come home together.",
  "1381070015": "Your familial devotion is...incomprehensible to me.",
  "1381070023": "Why are you so keen on being human when you\nscorn both family and love?",
  "1381080025": "Better that than being a coward with no faith\nin their own family. And more importantly...",
  "1380020027": "Luckily, we can use our network to get to a domain\nnear the temple.",
  "1380020064": "Of course.\nA family that sticks together, stays together.",
  "1380020016": "Once she connects to it,\nEden's reinitialization will begin right away.",
  "1381070018": "But while I cannot say for her, the real Lilly did love me.",
  "1380020031": "Her brain was removed, partially mechanized,\nand implanted into her chest.",
  "1381010055": "You're the one who said to follow my heart.",
  "1380030035": "There's definitely plenty of love.",
  "1380020101": "You're simply brimming with affection.",
  "1381010030": "Because it's not as if I want you to thank me.",
  "1381000006": "We're not living to fight, but fighting to live.\nTo be together in times like this.",
  "1380030007": "As I have nothing to offer in combat,\naiding you in this manner is the least I can do.",
  "1380020048": "Even when backing us up in battle, you\ncan only do one person at a time, right?",
  "1380110003": "Is she out of order?",
  "1380050011": "It's definitely hostile!",
  "1380050008": "The Star Temple is also the place where Eve\nwas being stored, so she must've already been\nmanipulating the central management system.",
  "1380020039": "Ordinary machines would break just trying to attack her.\nEven an E.V.E. would get their data corrupted with every\nstrike.",
  "1381060072": "...what a Real Human is.",
  "1380020082": "Oh, that's right. You said you wanted to be a\nReal Human, but never elaborated on why.",
  "1381060010": "What's the logic behind that?",
  "1380110007": "It's coming, Leben! Ready up!",
  "1381010016": "This life and the next are entirely separate things!\nYou ought to be crystal clear with your feelings for\nme in the present!",
  "1380090008": "It seems that way. Against these facsimiles, at least.",
  "1380120015": "I think they're perfect for the job. Other than against\nthe facsimiles, E.V.E. are still on top.",
  "1381060030": "A machine with a heart is the very height of sacrilege.\nBut the theory of Idea Code in itself is an exceptional\nrarity.",
  "1381090045": "There's a machine right here. I'll change this rotten\nfate by my own will. Just watch!",
  "1380090007": "Are you saying our dominance as E.V.E. over machines\nis gone?",
  "1381020023": "Stow your doubts and stay the course.\nOur fates are in your hands.",
  "1381070022": "What a deplorable mindset.",
  "1380090013": "Be careful, Leben.",
  "1381010014": "\"Either live with me forever, or reincarnate at my\nside for eternity.\" That's what you told me, right?",
  "1381020036": "You can't go back to sleep if you never wake up.\nLet's fight for a good night that ends in a good morning.",
  "1380020055": "It's decided.",
  "1380020050": "That seems reckless.",
  "1381060004": "It's made out of a special material,\nso our attacks won't have any effect.",
  "1381090052": "I couldn't lay out the logic if I tried.\nBut all the same, this is the reality.",
  "1381090047": "Live, live, live, live, live!\nSurvive no matter what, Leben!!!",
  "1380100003": "The thrill of being alive...\nI want to experience it with you, too.",
  "1380100002": "You get to feel the thrill of being alive more\nintensely. But maybe that's just because of\nthe risk.",
  "1381040017": "Pitiful. Research machines playing at war.",
  "1380080003": "It makes a much greater impact in person.",
  "1380030033": "And to your machine sister, too. It's pretty awkward.",
  "1380040001": "Three eyes and four arms.\nA far cry from us, to be sure.",
  "1381010011": "I don't care! I'm the type that can't rest easy unless\nthings are put into words.",
  "1381080009": "You would spurn...an opportunity...to survive?",
  "1380020087": "The Dei ex Machina were like siblings to me,\nwhile the rest of the machines were my children.",
  "1381020024": "Besides, my works of art and I are not so weak\nthat we will succumb to low-ranking soldiers.",
  "1380020094": "It filled me with sadness and guilt. There I was,\nthe First Deus ex Machina, pushing everybody\nto believe a lie.",
  "1380020090": "Just like how I love machines as my own children...",
  "1380110006": "It's Letheia the Fifth!",
  "1380120012": "We'll be sure to keep the Eighth's central unit safe.",
  "1380050002": "It's the Fourth Deus ex Machina, Anthropos.\nBut how? I most assuredly defeated him already.",
  "1381020002": "If we need the garden, is the sector ahead not hooked\nup to the network either?",
  "1380030022": "Think nothing of it; the Imitation Garden is quite light.\nThat said...referring to it as your \"body\" feels rather...\nunderwhelming.",
  "1380030005": "And she has the Imitation Garden, too.",
  "1381020001": "We come with the Imitation Garden in tow.\nOur word is no \"load of carp,\" as you can see.",
  "1380030006": "I asked her to deliver it to us.\nWe're going to need it to keep moving forward.",
  "1380030008": "You had Zoe bring the Imitation Garden to a\ndangerous place like this? Why go to all that\ntrouble?",
  "1381060073": "You can save your breath.\nI already get what a human is by your standards.",
  "1381100014": "I have to protect...Leben...no matter what...!",
  "1380030029": "Did you hear that, Leben? How exciting.",
  "1381070011": "Your existence, the past you believe in, even your humanity...\nAll of it has been denied you.",
  "1380030027": "To walk through a field of flowers with Leben.",
  "1381020017": "So their little ceasefire was just the calm before the storm.",
  "1380020002": "My memory's about 70% corrupted, and I think I can only\nuse my functions a few more times. My files on Eve were\nkept in secure storage, though, so they're mostly intact.",
  "1380000000": "There's a lot we need to talk about, but\nbefore that: Leben has something to say.",
  "1380030011": "So we're in for an all-out war.\nOne we can't afford to lose.",
  "1381100009": "She's showing signs of overloading.\nI've seen Enoa like this only once before.",
  "1381010027": "No. It's far greater than just love.",
  "1380020010": "That doesn't matter. We're a family.",
  "1381030004": "...Centrifugal Syndrome.",
  "1381060046": "...it can also severely inhibit one's functionality,\nthe way Centrifugal Syndrome does.",
  "1380070003": "After rain comes fair weather, as they say.",
  "1381070017": "You refer to Lilly of the LILLY Project.\nWe were never acquainted.",
  "1380030037": "Your face is red as a beet.",
  "1380120019": "Give an E.V.E. a fish...and she'll have a fish.\nThis will go swimmingly.",
  "1390020000": "A month later...",
  "1390010011": "What do you think!? You nag us over and over about\nbeing careful, just to up and disappear like that!?",
  "1390010001": "...",
  "1390010009": "You're going to spend the rest of your existence making up\nfor all the grief you've caused me--and everyone else, too.",
  "1390000005": "What is that...door...?",
  "1390010016": "...Okay. Then don't forgive. Instead...stay with me, Leben.\nFor as long as we live.",
  "1390010004": "Where is this...? Where was I earlier...?",
  "1390000003": "Is this...hell for machines?",
  "1390000002": "What is this world...?",
  "1390010014": "I'm sorry. But that's a real problem.\nI can't smile or be happy unless you do the same.",
  "1390010007": "Does that mean...I'm still alive?",
  "1390010015": "Enoa, you idiot! I'll never...EVER forgive you!\nI won't let you go again for as long as I live!",
  "1390020001": "■Ecclesia\nEnjoys peace and freedom with the restored Huginn & Muninn.",
  "1390020004": "■Mikoto & Ami\nPledged eternity to one another.",
  "1390020002": "■Trinity\nLives out days of mayhem and adventure.",
  "1390020003": "■Zoe\nRestored Lilly with a humanitarian approach.\nWe interact with and educate her every day.",
  "1390010012": "You have no idea how sad I was...\nHow much you made me worry!",
  "1390010013": "There's no way I could smile in a world without you.\nThere's no way I could...be happy...",
  "1390030001": "Uh. One short of a thousand, maybe? Don't ask me.",
  "1390010008": "That's right, Enoa. You're still alive.\nAnd now that we've settled that...",
  "1390040001": "Please continue to share your life with us.",
  "1390000001": "Why am I still here?",
  "1390010005": "The Imitation Garden on both counts. We were experiencing\nyour memories vicariously and repairing any corrupted data.",
  "1390030002": "Hey, Leben?",
  "1390030000": "It's so pretty. How many do you think there are?",
  "1390010010": "Are you mad, Leben?",
  "1390010000": "Leben? Mikoto? Ami?",
  "1390030003": "I love you.",
  "1390010003": "We were getting tired of waiting.",
  "1390000000": "I remember. Didn't I break down and disappear?",
  "1390040000": "Fight. Kill. Struggle. And despite it all, live.\nLive, live, live, and survive.",
  "1390010006": "Zoe helped us gather as many of them as we could\nfrom the server farms scattered around Eden.",
  "1390000004": "I feel like someone is calling my name.",
  "1390010002": "You're a late riser.",
  "1413004012": "Either that, or I've lost part of my memory due to my\ncurrent inadequate state.",
  "1410000017": "Yes. But there's nothing we can do about it.\nYou would have to be a god to know for sure.",
  "1411001004": "At that fleeting moment, they were the two datasets\nwith the highest humanity in the virtual world I'd\nbeen observing.",
  "1411006008": "You mean to imply she isn't attractive?!",
  "1412004016": "...That sort of thing.",
  "1413005008": "Lemme guess--you were hoping that one of the test\nsubjects was a whale. Right, Leben?",
  "1411005015": "That's what your lips say, but your heart tells me\nyou just want a private tropical getaway with her.",
  "1413006027": "And that deserves a gold star.",
  "1412001019": "Well, whatever the case...",
  "1413005004": "But this was nearly two thousand years ago, long before\nwe Dei ex Machina had concepts of self, so the data is\nlikely incomplete.",
  "1411006021": "You don't think she's cute or pretty?\nIs she not your type, then? Do you not like her?",
  "1411003007": "The possibilities are endless!",
  "1410000011": "A given galaxy would then be capable of housing up to\n100 million virtual earths.",
  "1413004019": "Perfection can be isolating.\nA friendly face makes you more fun to be around.",
  "1413004004": "As it happens, I only just found out about designer babies\nfrom the material myself.",
  "1413000004": "It's hard to say. There's no data on them in the\narchives, nor in our Dei ex Machina memory banks.",
  "1411007010": "But if the head is destroyed, the Personality Data\nwill be wiped away in turn. It is the equivalent of\ndying in this world.",
  "1411001010": "It wasn't until afterward that I was able to create the\nImitation Garden and provide us some peace of mind.",
  "1412004022": "...",
  "1412001013": "Th-That's...pretty heavy.",
  "1411006020": "...",
  "1411006025": "...",
  "1412000000": "...",
  "1412000007": "Then, the people who got \"incorporated\"...\nAre they dead?",
  "1411007008": "Then in those bodies, it's more or less our brain...",
  "1410000003": "Thought so... Is there any way to check?",
  "1413001003": "Oh! Speaking of, we don't know your birthday, Leben!",
  "1412001018": "That sounds like a stretch...",
  "1412000012": "...Right.",
  "1412004002": "Hm... Nothing really comes to mind... But if I had to\npick, I guess it'd be when people neglect machines.",
  "1413006020": "Hm. Is there a food that you're curious about, then?",
  "1412002011": "Is...that what sharks are like? The ones belonging\nto the Elasmobranchii class under the superorder\nSelachimorpha?",
  "1411005018": "Quit teasing me...",
  "1410000010": "Next, suppose that 10,000 virtual earths could be\ncreated inside each of those 10,000 virtual systems.",
  "1412003003": "I see. Guess we'll have to live not just for ourselves,\nbut for everybody else, too...",
  "1411002003": "Not to mention...",
  "1413004010": "In that case...",
  "1413001004": "I'm pretty sure it was October 21st...\nWhat about you?",
  "1412005001": "Ugh... This question...",
  "1413004009": "But the material made it sound like designer babies\nDID have a major impact...",
  "1413001012": "This gives me an idea...",
  "1412000003": "Is...that a problem?",
  "1413006003": "...That's a tough one.\nI...never really cared all that much about eating.",
  "1412005010": "O...kay...?\nWhy don't we move on to your favorite movies, Ami?",
  "1412001006": "...Good to hear, I guess?",
  "1411001006": "I see...",
  "1413002008": "Is that so...?\nWell, whoever made them is pretty amazing.",
  "1410000016": "That's...not the most comforting conclusion.",
  "1411006018": "That was just...you know... I was still half asleep...",
  "1413006013": "For real...? The elegant tea party in my head is\nlooking more like a shopping mall cafeteria now...",
  "1410000000": "Hey, Enoa, this is just hypothetical, but...",
  "1411006003": "Yeah...?",
  "1411006005": "Excuse me?",
  "1411004006": "That's ridiculous... And why are you talking like that?",
  "1411000013": "Uh...huh...",
  "1413002012": "Wow. I guess we ought to be grateful to them, then...",
  "1411000012": "Think of it as everyone taking different-sided dice with\ndifferent outcomes and rolling them in different places.",
  "1411005031": "Mine?",
  "1411005032": "Let me think... One thing I would bring...\nHmm...",
  "1413006016": "And so my image of Ami collapses...",
  "1413000000": "Developing Eden... Creating supertechnologies...",
  "1412002016": "That makes sense coming from you, but...",
  "1411006024": "But I wouldn't call her my \"type,\" per se...",
  "1411005008": "I'm on the fence between a volleyball and a talking\ncorpse... Y'know what? Let's do the corpse. Can't\nget more practical than that.",
  "1413001007": "...By a whopping three months.",
  "1413003003": "Treasonous?",
  "1412004015": "Betraying your family... Breaking promises...",
  "1413006025": "If I had to pick one...",
  "1411001001": "They were the optimal solution...\nOr should I say I was guided by fate.",
  "1412002002": "I've never had one, but aren't they just troublemakers\nwho do whatever the hell they want, everyone else be\ndamned?",
  "1411000003": "The logic is very complicated...",
  "1411001003": "When the storage pool exploded during the ambush,\nI engaged the emergency evacuation process, which\nlasted less than a tenth of a second in reality.",
  "1412005016": "My memory's still fuzzy, so I don't remember too well...",
  "1412001015": "Not in detail or anything, but yeah.\nAs for my parents, I don't think I liked them much.",
  "1411001011": "That must've been rough...",
  "1411006022": "...?",
  "1412002019": "...?",
  "1411000011": "...?",
  "1412004001": "The question is:\n\"What's the one thing you simply cannot tolerate?\"",
  "1411005004": "If you could bring one thing to a deserted island,\nwhat would it be?",
  "1413001016": "Just give up and let it happen.\nAmi goes beast mode over anniversaries.",
  "1413001014": "I'm not a fan of flashy parties.",
  "1412003000": "So, what happens to all of the Personality Data we've been\ncollecting?",
  "1410000001": "Isn't it possible that the Eden we think is\nreal is actually inside the virtual world?",
  "1412002000": "You already know mine...but do any of you guys have\na favorite animal?",
  "1411005013": "If it were a virtual island, I'd go with Enoa.\nShe'd be the most reliable choice, hands down.",
  "1411007006": "Then Mikoto, Ami, and I each have our own, right?",
  "1411001007": "There's another thing I've been wondering.\nWas the raid recent?",
  "1412001011": "Also, as with Mikoto's, my younger sister was also\nborn from the second marriage.",
  "1412004007": "And don't get me started on sliced shiitake mushrooms.",
  "1411005016": "Oh my. How wily of you.",
  "1411006001": "Why so serious all of a sudden?",
  "1410000002": "It could be.",
  "1413004005": "Huh? That's weird.\nDidn't the virtual simulation you ran emulate that period?",
  "1412002004": "Well, if we go by that angle, Mikoto's kind of catlike\nherself.",
  "1411005024": "Please. It might sound heartwarming, but if you think\nabout it, we'd be getting dragged out to the middle of\nnowhere.",
  "1412005012": "Your taste sounds...diverse.",
  "1411006023": "No, I mean, Enoa's definitely cute and pretty.\nBeing a machine makes her easy to talk to,\nand she's a really nice girl.",
  "1411006007": "No. I'm not into Mikoto.",
  "1412002018": "Hey! It was a perfectly acceptable answer!\nAny reminder of Enoa's love for humanity\nis a gold star in my book!",
  "1411006012": "Oof. Should've just come clean about it, Leben.\nYour type is AI girls who hand out gold stars like candy.",
  "1411006015": "Hey, come on now. You're always soft on Enoa.\nRemember how flustered you were calling her\nan angel at first sight?",
  "1413004002": "No. The research couldn't have produced tangible results\nwithin that time frame...in my opinion.",
  "1411001008": "No. It was 260 million seconds ago.\nThat is, approximately eight years.",
  "1412001007": "When my dad remarried, he dragged me with.\nAfter that, he and his new wife had a daughter\ntogether: my little sis.",
  "1412001010": "I was part of a blended family as well, except in\nmy case, it was my mother who brought me along.",
  "1412000001": "What's the matter, Enoa?",
  "1411005023": "Heehee.",
  "1411007005": "Yes, that's close enough.",
  "1411007009": "Yes, so be sure to avoid taking cranial damage.\nAny other location can typically be repaired.",
  "1412003004": "Yes. In the name of a better future.",
  "1412005019": "Um... That's okay.\nI never said I wanted to watch a comedy.",
  "1411006014": "Huh... Uh... N-No, that's not it...",
  "1413001010": "Really? Does this place even have a calendar?",
  "1412005008": "Uh... What does that even mean?",
  "1411005001": "Wait, huh? What's going on all of a sudden?",
  "1411006009": "Huh?\nDon't tell me I was supposed to say the opposite...",
  "1412004012": "Aww. I was only trying my best to validate you!",
  "1410000008": "What?!",
  "1413000005": "What? Why not?",
  "1413005007": "Possibly, yes.",

  "1412004018": "Trust me. I know firsthand how scary this woman can be.",
  "1413002004": "Its methodology is impossible to replicate,\nnot that there's much value in doing so now.",
  "1411003003": "Science has advanced this far, yet the answer still\neludes us? How bizarre...",
  "1412004010": "There it is! Another one of Mikoto's distinctive\nsensibilities that nobody else can comprehend!",
  "1412004003": "Tell me somethin' we don't know, Miss Mechanophile.",
  "1412004008": "Sliced...shiitake mushrooms?",
  "1412005007": "In that case, my pick goes to the brutal, ruthless,\ncannibalistic inferno.",
  "1411006006": "Is it slightly older women with short hair, fantastic,\nrunway-ready bodies, and an appreciation for cinema?",
  "1413006002": "I was just a little curious.",
  "1413002009": "Amazing isn't sufficient to describe his--or her--genius.\nWithout them, humanity would have no future.",
  "1413006012": "Why, croquette sandwiches, of course!",
  "1411007003": "Yes, the source of our self-awareness.",
  "1413006024": "Always twisting my words...\nSo, Enoa? Anything come to mind?",
  "1413006018": "You should answer too, Enoa.",
  "1412005000": "Hey, Mikoto.\nIs there a movie you'd rank at the top of your list?",
  "1412001000": "So, what kind of families did you two grow up in?",
  "1411003000": "By the way, whatever happened with Centrifugal Syndrome?",
  "1413004017": "Exactly. I'm not amazing at all.\nI'm a shoddy Deus ex Machina.",
  "1411006013": "Is it really?",
  "1413005009": "You'd have to be psycho to wish that on your favorite\nanimal.",
  "1411000002": "I know that part, but how does it actually work?",
  "1413002010": "They were that good, huh?",
  "1412002003": "That's what makes them so lovable!",
  "1411000004": "Sum it up for me.",
  "1413002006": "As for the Fruit and Tree of Knowledge, they are\nneurodigitization and brain-computer interface\ntechnologies respectively.",
  "1412005006": "It's easier to answer questions like these by thinking\nof what message you want to send about yourself.",
  "1412005013": "Fun fact: both of those films had the same screenwriter.",
  "1411005005": "That depends... Is this an actual island we're on?\nOr is it in virtual reality?",
  "1413006007": "You stay in shape with a diet like that?\nNo fair.",
  "1412004013": "That aside, what would your answer be, Ami?",
  "1411006010": "Doing that would've made you a sudden rival\nfor Mikoto's affections--MUCH to my distress!",
  "1411004003": "I'm sure it'll be fine. She's never acted malicious\nor hostile toward us before.",
  "1413000002": "Why generalize? It was the same developer in both\ncases, right? That makes them the real genius here.",
  "1410000009": "Let's say, for example, that we were able to produce\n10,000 virtual star systems per galaxy.",
  "1413004006": "To provide a parallel, raising fish in an aquarium wouldn't\nnecessarily mean that you have a total understanding of\neach one.",
  "1412000008": "It's more that they're in a state of suspended animation.\nThey can still be recovered.",
  "1411001005": "Therefore, it was fate.",
  "1412005004": "I mean, you're an expert on the subject.\nOf course I'd want to hear your opinion.",
  "1411000010": "In other words, there's only one of each\nin this entire universe. Just like with souls.",
  "1412002007": "What about you, Mikoto?\nWhat's your favorite animal?",
  "1412004017": "You hear that, Mikoto? You'd better watch out.",
  "1410000005": "But we can approximate the probability that this world\nis the true, primary reality via a thought experiment.",
  "1412000009": "Even so, this is a violation of human rights...\nMy deepest apologies.",
  "1411003002": "But the cause remains unknown. Even continued analysis\nof contemporary data hasn't revealed anything definitive.",
  "1411004007": "To be fair, Ami's instincts are always right on the meow-ny.",
  "1412001008": "The old man couldn't stand me, though, so I grew up\nsomewhere on the halfway point of the neglect scale.",
  "1411004004": "What makes you so confident?",
  "1413002007": "Both involve the human brain. As there are no biological\nhumans in Eden, neither one can be studied or verified.",
  "1411005006": "I will accept either interpretation!",
  "1413004016": "At any rate, it's nice to know that you have your faults.",
  "1412002013": "Take that back! Cinema is ABOVE classification.\nIt's a fair playing ground with universal appeal!",
  "1411004009": "Wh-What the hell is happening?",
  "1410000015": "In those terms, the chance of ours being the base reality\nis so infinitesmally low that it would constitute a miracle.",
  "1412002010": "Then sharks. They can merge with octopi, ride in\nwaterspouts, get possessed by demons, pop out\nof toilets, and so on. I never get sick of 'em.",
  "1412001016": "Huh. So all three of us come from similar backgrounds.\nWhat're the odds?",
  "1412005002": "What's wrong with it?",
  "1411007004": "I think I get the gist of it. Basically, a set of Personality\nData is a full human psyche, complete with memories\nand a soul.",
  "1411004008": "Meow.",
  "1413002001": "Hey, Enoa.\nJust what are these supertechnologies for, anyway?",
  "1411006000": "Leben. A word?",
  "1411005003": "Yeah, yeah. So, what's the question?",
  "1412004021": "One worthy of a gold star.",
  "1411003008": "Those sound pretty cool, actually.",
  "1412001003": "Wow... No minced words.\nShould I have kept this topic to myself?",
  "1411005000": "Ta-da! It's time for Ami's Pop Quiz Corner!",
  "1412004000": "Ta-da! We're back with Ami's Pop Quiz Corner!",
  "1411006002": "I just have one very important question to ask you.",
  "1412003002": "Each and every dataset is valuable. Even if they\naren't Real Humans, I treasure them all the same.",
  "1412000005": "To put it succinctly, those same individuals are being\nprocessed and weaponized.",
  "1412004019": "No need to worry. These two are very close.",
  "1411005002": "Hehehe. Just a little something for us to grow\ncloser to one another. That, and stave off my\nboredom!",
  "1411006017": "Hehehe. We heard the whole thing from start to finish.",
  "1413001017": "You're my beloved family! It's only natural\nto honor the days we came into this world!",
  "1411002005": "Wow. Now that's sci-fi.",
  "1410000006": "Alright, what's the probability then?",
  "1412005018": "Oh, yeah? Then I've got a recommendation. It's a story\nabout Frankenstein's descendant building robots outta\ncorpses.",
  "1413003005": "Huh. Guess they don't have it easy, either.",
  "1413001008": "That's nice and all, but I don't think it really matters\nhere in this world.",
  "1413003001": "That's news to me. Do they just go berserk without it?",
  "1410000007": "Almost zero percent.",
  "1413004018": "That's not the way I'd describe you.\nStill, it's better to be approachable than flawless.",
  "1412002014": "Let's save this topic for another conversation...\nDo you have a favorite animal, Enoa?",
  "1411005014": "You can count on me.",
  "1413004014": "That can't be. It would entail a full-blown conspiracy.",
  "1411005030": "Oh, but we aren't finished quite yet.\nYou still have to tell us your answer, Enoa.",
  "1413006017": "Everyone's individuality is really shining through.",
  "1413004013": "Another possibility is that it WAS historical fact, but\npeople found it so unsavory that they went out of\ntheir way to make sure it wouldn't get passed on.",
  "1411005025": "She thinks that being family means following her to the\ndepths of hell. What a nightmare. Especially if this is a\nreal island we're talking.",
  "1412004020": "Why, naturally.\nOur relationship is eternal and unyielding!",
  "1413006015": "Naturally. Nothing could ever hope to compare with\npeach tea from the convenience store.",
  "1411005026": "Obviously, I'm assuming it's all a simulation.\nAs long as Enoa is there, we'd be safe and secure.",
  "1411005022": "Ami is as family-oriented as ever.",
  "1413005001": "It seems that way.",
  "1413005002": "Seems?",
  "1413004015": "Well... You never can tell.",
  "1413004008": "I'm only aware of the factors that had a major impact\non human history.",
  "1413001015": "Mine is only a manufacture date.\nAnd a machine doesn't warrant such festivity...",
  "1412004024": "I suppose it would be you girls getting hurt.",
  "1413006019": "I'm a machine. I have neither a body with which to eat,\nnor an actual need to do so.",
  "1412004011": "...Hey, Ami.\nMaybe ease up on the backhanded compliments.",
  "1413006011": "Those suit you. What sort of bread was it?\nOne of those fancy, artisanal kinds?",
  "1411005021": "We should've known.",
  "1413006009": "What was it you liked again, Ami?",
  "1411005019": "What would you bring, Ami?",
  "1413006014": "Who knew Ami's palate was so plain-Jane?\nLemme guess: you drank tea from a pack, too.",
  "1413002011": "They were also responsible for the development\nof Eden and the Dei ex Machina, single-handedly\ncausing numerous technological breakthroughs.",
  "1413000003": "Their accomplishments are certainly extensive.\nCould you tell us what kind of person they were,\nEnoa?",
  "1412002017": "You'd be giving off some minor psychopath\nvibes if we didn't know you were a machine.",
  "1411006019": "So you're saying Enoa ISN'T an angel?",
  "1413006022": "I just want to get to know her.",
  "1411001000": "What made you choose Mikoto and Ami for help\nback when you got attacked?",
  "1412004023": "So, what's something you can't let slide, Enoa?",
  "1413001000": "So you were born on June 7th, Enoa?",
  "1412004026": "That deserves a gold star too!",
  "1412001001": "A shitty one.",
  "1413006026": "...it'd be cake. People are always gathering around them\nwith smiles on their faces. It's a food that symbolizes joy.",
  "1411003006": "Spirits! Demons! Ghost worms!\nPsychic grudges! Universal errors!",
  "1411000007": "Deciding someone's priorities through luck of the draw\nsounds pretty sloppy to me.",
  "1412005005": "But what's at \"the top\" changes based on the genre\nand ranking criteria. I can't just pick one to cover all\nthe bases.",
  "1412004006": "Like when people leave their seats in the middle of the\ncredits, or special order full-bodied ramens with thinner\nbroth.",
  "1413002003": "The volume of data it can record is tremendous,\nespecially in proportion to its physical dimensions.",
  "1413004011": "...what the material says on the subject must not be\nreliable.",
  "1411003004": "Either the data is incomplete...or the cause can't\nbe explained by science. Perhaps it's something...\nsupernatural. ",
  "1411004000": "Noah sure is mysterious, isn't she?",
  "1411000006": "This is to account for the frame problem, which concerns\nthe issue at the root of volition: how to determine what\nshould be focused on in the first place.",
  "1413006004": "What about you, Mikoto?",
  "1413006006": "Pairing it with a side of rice topped with pickled cucumbers,\nchili bean paste, and sesame seeds makes life that much\nmore worth it.",
  "1411005017": "That's very nice to hear, Leben.",
  "1411006026": "Oh, I understand your predilections plenty now, Leben.\nThis has been most educational.",
  "1412001014": "What about your family, Leben?\nYou remembered some stuff about your sister, right?",
  "1411006004": "What are your sexual preferences?\nBy which I mean: what is your type?",
  "1412005015": "So, what kind of movies are you into, Leben?",
  "1413006000": "Did you have a favorite food, Leben?",
  "1412002005": "That only further cements my affection for her!",
  "1413006010": "I was rather partial to bread and black tea.",
  "1411005020": "My family--which in this case, is everyone here.\nBeing separated would be terribly lonesome.",
  "1412005011": "I like the one with the cute, little pig who wants to\nherd sheep, or the one where they tear through a\npost-apocalyptic wasteland with fire-spewing guitars.",
  "1412002001": "I simply adore cats! They're fluffy, classy...\nAnd vigilant, to boot!",
  "1413001006": "Mine is April 5th, which makes me the oldest human\nin the group!",
  "1412001002": "Mine was also far from an ideal environment.",
  "1412001005": "I agree. Especially now that I'm surrounded\nby the most adorable family I could ask for!",
  "1410000013": "On the other hand, there is only one base reality--\none true world.",
  "1410000004": "A lower plane cannot verify the existence of a higher one.",
  "1413004007": "In the same vein, running a simulation of a world\ndoesn't guarantee that I know everything about it.",
  "1411005007": "Gotcha. I'll go ahead and make this quick, then.",
  "1411003001": "Apparently, after drastically reducing the population\nat the end of human history, the disease eventually\nfaded away.",
  "1412000004": "Each set of P.D. is a human from the virtual world\nEnoa created.",
  "1412002015": "Humans.",
  "1411005011": "Human imagination knows no bounds.",
  "1413005006": "If the aim was to digitize humans, then they must have\nbeen genetically similar species, right?",
  "1411002004": "Cybernetic augmentation was very common in late\nhuman history, and the values of preserving one's\nflesh and bones became less of a priority.",
  "1413004001": "You said it took six months after my death for humanity\nto go extinct. Is that when they were created?",
  "1411004002": "We may get along for now, but it would not be\nsafe to trust her completely just yet.",
  "1413001013": "We've only been celebrating my and Mikoto's birthdays\nthus far. But next time, we'll be sure to throw a big bash\nfor you two as well!",
  "1411002006": "You make it sound like someone else's business,\nbut for us, those circumstances are anything but\nfiction.",
  "1411007001": "It is a person's psychological data reproduced in the\nvirtual world--a composite of recollections and Idea\nCode.",
  "1411007007": "In the virtual world, it's not so much a matter of having\nas it is a matter of being. During combat, however, it's\nstored in the head of your Synthetic Frames.",
  "1412001020": "Memories from the virtual world belong to our previous\nlives. Let's focus on the present. This family gathering\nisn't going to enjoy itself!",
  "1411006011": "This conversation's a minefield.",
  "1413001002": "Isn't that the same thing?",
  "1413006008": "Blame my metabolism.\nI couldn't put on weight even if I wanted to.",
  "1411005010": "There's this movie about a man who uses a dead\nbody to get home after being marooned. That guy\nwas jam-packed with handy features.",
  "1412004025": "Considerate as ever, huh?",
  "1411007002": "Again with the Idea Code...\nWhat is it again? The soul, or something?",
  "1411006027": "Whatever you're thinking, it's ninety-percent wrong.",
  "1412004014": "It's plain and simple!",
  "1412000010": "I'll look past it, since they can still be brought back.",
  "1411005027": "Family matters, but my wish to be together, even in\nthe depths of hell, only applies to Mikoto specifically.",
  "1411000008": "Don't worry. As I said, the dice are specialized.",
  "1411006016": "Wait. Were you listening in on us back then?",
  "1412001017": "We all had a younger sister and an unhappy\nhome life. Perhaps having a poor relationship\nwith one's father equates to higher humanity?",
  "1411002002": "Organic matter is too fragile to survive in space.\nKnowing this, they sought something that would be\nmore robust without compromising their humanity.",
  "1413002005": "Optimizing storage is no longer cost-effective\nwhen Eden has such an abundance of space.",
  "1411004001": "I can't get a read on her. Feels like wherever we\ngo in Eden, she's there waiting for us.",
  "1413005000": "So, Eden even had animal test subjects on board\nback then.",
  "1412004005": "Damn straight. I think you're startin' to get me, Leben.\nBut there are other things I can't stand, too.",
  "1413004003": "In your opinion?",
  "1413006001": "What is this, Ami's Pop Quiz Corner?",
  "1412005014": "That's crazy.",
  "1411000001": "It is a technology that generates volition.",
  "1413005003": "The manifest does indicate that they were present...",
  "1412004004": "As for Miss Cinephile, I'll bet you lose your mind\nwhen people are loud in a movie theater, right?",
  "1412005003": "It's the same one I get from every person I meet the\nsecond they find out I'm a film buff.",
  "1413003002": "Not quite.\nIts purpose is to suppress treasonous behavior.",
  "1411000015": "Or maybe God plays dice more than we realize.",
  "1412002009": "Sure, why not?",
  "1412005017": "I think I liked movies that starred machines.",
  "1411005034": "Ah. That certainly would be a dire concern for a machine.",
  "1413001011": "Not a functional one, but I can still calculate the date\nmanually.",
  "1411005012": "How 'bout you, Leben? What would you bring?",
  "1411005009": "How is a corpse practical?",
  "1413001009": "Even so, we make a point of celebrating every year.",
  "1411005033": "Given that the deserted island is in reality, then...\nperhaps...a source of power?",
  "1411003009": "A lineup of the most dubious occult cases ever.",
  "1412000002": "I've discovered that Personality Data has been\nincorporated into the Auxiliaries and Sentiments.",
  "1411000014": "Someone once said, \"God does not play dice,\"\nbut I guess the same isn't true for machines.",
  "1413003004": "Apparently, there were some Cherubim who revolted\nagainst the Dei ex Machina. According to the report,\nanyway.",
  "1411005028": "Just me, huh? Guess I'd better start packing.",
  "1412001009": "The silver screen raised me more than my parents.\nThat's how I got my good taste.",
  "1413006005": "Rich tonkotsu shoyu ramen was my jam.\nI'd go out and eat it several times a week.",
  "1412005009": "I'm introducing myself as a lover of blood-red satire.",
  "1413001005": "Mine's July 18th.",

  "1413002000": "The Imitation Garden, Fruit of Knowledge,\nand Tree of Knowledge...",
  "1413002002": "The Imitation Garden serves as a storage unit for\nthis virtual world.",
  "1412004009": "They're gross. Makes me think of arthropod feet.",
  "1413000001": "It's amazing what humans can do when the end is near.",
  "1411004005": "Intuition and experience, of course. But most importantly,\nshe's cute--and that justifies anything. Her features, her\nkittyspeak... It's all paw-sitively purr-fect.",
  "1411002000": "A Synthetic Frame is supposed to be a reproduction of\nthe human body, right? Then why are they mechanical?\nSeems counterintuitive.",
  "1410000014": "Now weigh that singular world against an effectively\ninfinite number of virtual ones.",
  "1413006021": "You didn't give a crap about this two seconds ago.\nBut hey, anything to sink your teeth into Enoa, eh?",
  "1412000006": "I believe the intent is to empower the wielder by\nincreasing their humanity.",
  "1412002006": "I can't tell I'm being dragged or praised.\nOr how I'm supposed to feel about it.",
  "1413001001": "Not born. Manufactured.",
  "1411000005": "Put simply, the process utilizes specialized dice to direct\na subject's focus.",
  "1413000006": "Someone appears to have deleted it intentionally.\nTheir reasons, however, are anyone's guess.",
  "1411000000": "Even after reading through the material,\nI'm not sure I really get what Idea Code is.",
  "1413003000": "I never realized that a Cherub's armor was a restraining\ndevice until I read the material.",
  "1411007000": "I have a question. What exactly IS Personality Data?\nIt keeps coming up in conversation, but I'm not sure\nI really get it.",
  "1411005029": "Everyone's responses are so personalized.",
  "1411003005": "Supernatural?",

  "1411002001": "The somatic reconstruction process is a bit irregular,\nbut humans did not wish to reproduce their original\nphysical forms.",
  "1411001002": "Fate?",

  "1413004000": "Designer babies... I didn't even know genetically modified\nhumans were a thing before that document mentioned it.",

  "1422000003": "They are.",

  "1430003019": "What's an ideal day off look like for you, Enoa?",
  "1432006010": "You tailored your response to fit MY love of cats!",
  "1432006027": "Being able to smile together is more than special enough.",
  "1432005007": "The virtual world is all in the past. Whatever life I\nled in there already came to a clean end. Period.",
  "1430003021": "So just having a break in and of itself may be ideal for me.",
  "1432006003": "Answer denied! That isn't the least bit interesting!\nI want to hear something more...unexpected!",
  "1430001005": "What, Little Miss Re-Cleaner? Yeah, that pretty\nmuch says it all. Lemme try and suss out how it\nwent.",
  "1432007012": "I love you, Ami, from the bottom of my heart. Let's be\ntogether in this life and the next, always and forever.",
  "1430000008": "This is an issue we'll have to confront sooner or\nlater for the sake of our own safety and security.",
  "1430000005": "Those things are an E.V.E.'s perfect nemesis.\nAnd according to Noah, there are seven more of them...",
  "1432007032": "...!",
  "1432007034": "...",
  "1432007035": "...",
  "1432007029": "I love you very, very much.",
  "1430002010": "...",
  "1432006029": "...",
  "1432007023": "...",
  "1432007028": "...I love you back, Enoa.",
  "1432004018": "Or, actually... Now that I think back, maybe\nLetheia the Fifth managed to piece it together...",
  "1432007031": "Me too. I love you so much. You're more special than\nanything else in the universe.",
  "1432002011": "Oh...",
  "1430002007": "...For all the unspeakable acts she committed,\nMikoto still returned home to us in the end.",
  "1432004015": "Ugh...",
  "1430001007": "What she SAID was \"Trinity,\" but what she MEANT was\n\"Quadrinity.\" Am I right, or am I right?",
  "1432003007": "Besides, what few memories I even have as\nPropator are foggy...as if I dreamed it all up.",
  "1432007021": "Alright...",
  "1431000004": "...You two can be real jerkwads.",
  "1430003023": "Even sweatshops have better conditions...",
  "1430002004": "...I'm not sure what you mean.",
  "1432000010": "Why's that?",
  "1432003001": "I don't see why not.\nWhat are you so worried about?",
  "1432003003": "I can't argue with that, but something about\nthe way you're wording it kind of annoys me...",
  "1432001004": "Right... At that time, I think he was trying to return\nmy Idea Code to me.",
  "1432001008": "Does...that mean things would've gone smoother if it\nweren't for me butting in?",
  "1432002013": "*sigh* I really bungled this one...",
  "1432001005": "From Ecclesia's point of view, I probably got in\nthe way, so he had no choice but to throw down.",
  "1432007019": "Ready, Enoa?",
  "1431000010": "I'll hate you for it.",
  "1432007022": "...I love you, Enoa.",
  "1432004011": "To be honest, I thought you guys would be totally\nstunned.",
  "1432007030": "...!",
  "1432002001": "Love or money. Which would you choose?",
  "1432006001": "Tell me what you would do on your ideal date.",
  "1430000011": "Right on. Once we find the other seven, we'll teach\n'em a painful lesson about what happens when they\nkeep us from livin' our lives.",
  "1430003016": "Let's see... I'm good with anything, as long as it's\nquiet enough for me to take my time resting and\nrelaxing.",
  "1432006023": "For me, it's walking through a field of flowers with\nEnoa. We even made a promise to do just that.",
  "1432001010": "I think that's what allowed me to properly develop my\nsense of self as Leben--and my fondness for all of you.",
  "1430003008": "Yeah. I'd like to see some past moments between you two.",
  "1432007025": "Also, from this point on, you have to keep saying\n\"I love you\" back and forth till I decide who takes\nthe match!",
  "1432001006": "As for him switchin' targets to Logos in the middle of\nthe fight... That was also to protect you, huh, Leben?",
  "1430002002": "Is she...broken beyond repair?\nThat is, has she perished for good?",
  "1430002000": "Whatever became of Lilly in the end?",
  "1431000006": "Oh? You admit this freely?",
  "1432005002": "Absolutely not.",
  "1432001001": "Thankfully, yeah.\nIt turns out he's been looking for me all this time.",
  "1430001006": "Oh boy. A guessing game.",
  "1432001009": "No. This is just hindsight talking, but not getting\nmy Idea Code back then left me a blank slate.",
  "1430002011": "Someday, when Eden settles down,\nand we can afford to spend time with her...",
  "1432001003": "Well, Leben was never actually attacked.",
  "1432007020": "Y-Yes... Go easy on me, Leben.",
  "1432004017": "No. Only Eve had the correct intel, so no one else could've\nknown that the information on humans had been corrupted.",
  "1431000003": "Heehee. Forgive me. The way you try so hard\nto pretend you aren't afraid is just too precious.",
  "1430003013": "Heehee. Just the thought of our joyous future has my\nchest doing flips!",
  "1432007037": "Heh heh heh.",
  "1431000007": "Yes. From now on, I've decided to follow my heart\nand act honestly.",
  "1432004006": "Yes. You're right. Without a doubt.",
  "1432002017": "Uh.",
  "1431000001": "Huh? What brought this on?",
  "1432007003": "What? You don't want to? But it sounds fun.",
  "1432005005": "Yes. My true family is sitting right here with me.",
  "1430003007": "Oh, now. Imagine watching your most heroic scenes\nin full, motion-picture glory. Hehehe... Now that'd be\na show to remember!",
  "1432006004": "What gives? You asked for my ideal date.\nI call foul.",
  "1430003004": "Sure, but it'd be worth squat without actual movies.\nWhat would we even watch?",
  "1430001001": "Oh yeah? Shoot.",
  "1432005001": "Would you consider going back to your original families?",
  "1432004008": "So long as we have hearts capable of sharing our\naffections, whether we're humans or machines or\nwhat have you is irrelevant!",
  "1432007000": "It's time to begin the first-ever \"I Love You\" game!",
  "1432001007": "You're spot on.",
  "1432002023": "I'll get back to you on that.",
  "1432006012": "Says who? It's probably just a coincidence.",
  "1432007017": "S-Sure. Let's do it.",
  "1430003012": "After everything is settled, we can go anywhere\nwe please in Eden or the restored virtual world.",
  "1432002014": "Just when I thought everyone had finally opened\ntheir eyes to the wonders of love. Hope can be\nso fleeting.",
  "1432004016": "Returning to the original topic...\nWas Noein aware of this too?",
  "1432003000": "Hey, is it alright if we keep calling you Leben?",
  "1430000009": "Agreed. If they ruin Eden, we're toast, and there's\nno way I'm gonna let them lay a finger on the Dei\nex--well, Enoa, at least.",
  "1432000005": "True enough.",
  "1432006011": "She did?",
  "1431000011": "And I'LL be pissed.",
  "1430003022": "Fair enough. You've been on the grind 24/7\nsince they booted you up 2000 years back.",
  "1432007016": "You guys might as well get it over with, too.\nI'll be the ref.",
  "1430000004": "That's right. You're so quick to understand. Good girl.",
  "1432003009": "So just call me Leben like you always have.\nThat's what I go by as a part of this family. ",
  "1432007039": "Blushy-wushy.",
  "1432000014": "But what does her origin story have to do\nwith why the information was concealed?",
  "1432002024": "One thing's for sure, though: picking your wallet\nover your heart is the lame way to go.",
  "1432004002": "You two don't sound all that shocked to me.",
  "1432007008": "Ugh. So, what's the \"I Love You\" game, again?",
  "1431000008": "Th-That changes everything...!",
  "1430002008": "Lilly may be detestable to the extreme, but I can't\nin good conscience call her the root of all evil.",
  "1430000002": "Judging by their outdated system designs, they\nmust have been cut off from Eden's network in\nthe past and never reconnected.",
  "1432006025": "I take it that your response will be the same, Enoa?",
  "1432000018": "Whatever the case, mankind persecuted Eve, called\nher a stain on human history, and tried to erase the\nrecords of her existence.",
  "1432002009": "How do you mean?",
  "1432006028": "So I'm sure I'd be happy no matter what we do.",
  "1432002006": "More importantly, who could have guessed that both\nLeben and Mikoto would take the sentimental option?",
  "1432001002": "If that's true, why did he attack us initially?",
  "1430003014": "Let's just keep it away from the hustle and bustle, please.",
  "1430000003": "I get it. Those guys are usin' an old measuring stick,\nso it's lowballing our humanity levels.",
  "1432006008": "I said what I said.",
  "1432002020": "Hooray.",
  "1432002015": "It's not fleeting. I made my choice honestly, not by\nprocess of elimination. Even if money were a valid\nresponse, I would still pick love.",
  "1431000000": "Hey, Enoa. How 'bout I tell some ghost stories?\nIt'll be fine since you don't scare easily, right?",
  "1432000013": "Yeah. Eve was a child prodigy, artificially created for\nthe sake of technological innovation.",
  "1430003009": "Alright, alright, enough about that.\nWhat's your ideal day off, Ami?",
  "1430003018": "What can I say? Mentally, I'm middle-aged.",
  "1432006022": "Whatever works. Your turn, Leben.",
  "1432007001": "Yeaaah, no.",
  "1430003000": "Ta-da! It's time for Ami's Pop Quiz Corner!",
  "1432002000": "Ta-da! It's another episode of Ami's Pop Quiz Corner!",
  "1432006000": "Ta-da! As sure as the sun rises in the morning,\nit's Ami's Pop Quiz Corner!",
  "1430000001": "For good reason. Their rebellion suppression mechanisms\naren't responding to your humanity properly.",
  "1432003006": "Can you please stop messing with my name?",
  "1430002003": "You're worried about her.\nI knew you were a kind soul, Ami.",
  "1432007007": "Heehee. That's three to one.\nThe majority has spoken: motion passed!",
  "1432006009": "Hehehe. I see what's going on here.",
  "1432007013": "Hehehe. Music to my ears.",
  "1432007011": "Fine, fine... Here goes.",
  "1432006015": "Anyway, enough about me.\nWhat's your perfect date, Ami?",
  "1432004000": "So, turns out we look nothing like historically\naccurate humans. Talk about a twist, huh?",
  "1432006013": "Don't play dumb! These subtle expressions of\nkindness are yet another of your many charms!",
  "1430003001": "Here's a question for all of you:\nWhat is your ideal day off?",
  "1432006026": "Of course. But that said...",
  "1432007033": "I...I...love you...more than anything else in the world...\nLeben...",
  "1432007026": "Okay.",
  "1432006024": "Exciting.",
  "1432005004": "We're happy to hear that, but are you sure?",
  "1432006006": "Fine. Then a trip to a cat cafe.",
  "1431000002": "Ami tipped me off.",
  "1432000009": "That's because any real information about Eve was\nconcealed on purpose.",
  "1432001011": "Ecclesia even evolved the ability to speak after the fact.",
  "1432002010": "We're on a hunk of metal flying through space.\nWhere would you spend it?",
  "1432007004": "I'm up for it if you are, Enoa.",
  "1432007006": "I know she's got you on a string, but that\nhad to be the fastest one-eighty in history.",
  "1432006007": "That's pretty surprising for someone so hung up on her\n\"cool factor.\" Do you even like cats in the first place?",
  "1432001013": "Que sera, sera.",
  "1432007024": "Safe. Next is Enoa's turn.",
  "1430002001": "Zoe retrieved her.",
  "1432000015": "It's because designer babies were discriminated against.",
  "1432000011": "Because she was a designer baby.",
  "1432000012": "You mean that fancy term for genetically engineered\nhumans?",
  "1430001002": "I asked Zoe how Trinity was named since you were\ncurious about it.",
  "1430001004": "Apparently, Hayat was the one responsible.",
  "1432003004": "If Propator is too difficult to say, how about we shorten\nit into a nickname, like \"Prop\"?",
  "1430003011": "One with the three of you, needless to say. I want\nus to make oodles of fun-filled memories together.",
  "1430001000": "I have good news, Mikoto.",
  "1432005000": "Hey, Mikoto, Ami.\nSay we repaired the virtual world after everything is over...",
  "1432007010": "Mikoto will go against me, while Leben will be pitted\nagainst Enoa!",
  "1432002022": "Aren't you the same, Mikoto?",
  "1430002005": "She can be repaired the same way Mikoto and\nTrinity were, since you didn't destroy her head.",
  "1432007018": "You're up first, Leben.",
  "1432004014": "Leben, the wishy-washy Deus ex Machina.",
  "1430003015": "Now it's your turn to answer, Leben.",
  "1432002016": "You would too, right, Leben?",
  "1432006016": "As long as I'm with you, Mikoto,\nanything would be a dream come true!",
  "1430003010": "I suppose for me, it'd be a family outing.",
  "1430001008": "Actually, she forgot to count herself as a member entirely.",
  "1432004007": "Our reasons for liking each other have nothing to\ndo with you being humans, nor me being a machine.",
  "1432000020": "Guess the ugly, trashy parts of humanity never change.",
  "1430003020": "If such an opportunity ever arrives, it'll mean my mission\nhas been fulfilled.",
  "1430002009": "A gold star for sweet Ami.",
  "1432002005": "A-Across the board!? I never dreamed I'd see\nthe day when all of you had the same answer!",
  "1432006017": "Answer denied.",
  "1430003006": "Hard pass! Who'd wanna watch their home movies\nup on the big screen? Talk about embarrassing.",
  "1432007002": "Agreed. Not happening.",
  "1432000022": "There is no such thing as natural or artificial when it\ncomes to life.",
  "1432004009": "Love requires nothing in return. If it's muddied by\nreason, logic, or ill intentions, then it's as good as\nfake!",
  "1432007005": "Hooray.",
  "1432004010": "That's nice and everything, but your reactions still\nfeel a little anticlimactic.",
  "1432002012": "There's practically only one answer.",
  "1432004003": "Well, it doesn't particularly affect us in any meaningful way.",
  "1430000010": "They won't be disrupting our tranquil little family on\nmy watch.",
  "1432004005": "Provided that our familial bond is real and we remain\ntrue to ourselves, I see no problems to be had.",
  "1432000003": "Even if we have that in common,\nthere's one major thing that sets us apart.",
  "1432000002": "It's no surprise, since you're E.V.E., but her family\nstructure was similar to the ones you guys had.",
  "1430000007": "Even without taking Noah's request into account, their\naim of destroying Eden and the Dei ex Machina makes\nthem a threat.",
  "1432004012": "What a worrywart.",
  "1431000009": "Now when we spook her, we'll get to hear even\nmore hilario--I mean, adorable screams of terror!",
  "1431000012": "Then I hereby swear never, ever to frighten Enoa.",
  "1430002006": "You avoided it on purpose, didn't you?",
  "1432006018": "Didn't you just say you wanted something unexpected?",
  "1432002002": "Love.",
  "1432007009": "We take turns saying \"I love you\" to each other,\nand whoever gets shy or laughs, loses!",
  "1432007027": "I love you, Leben.",
  "1432002004": "It's gotta be love.",
  "1432002003": "I'd say love.",
  "1432002021": "Leben Distel: Slave to Passion.",
  "1432004013": "Always taking things upon yourself.",
  "1430003005": "Our archives don't contain any film footage, so the only\nthing we'd be able to project is our memories together.",
  "1432006002": "Go see a movie.",
  "1430003003": "If all you want is a theater, we can recreate one here.",
  "1430003002": "Spending the whole thing at a multiplex and binging\nflicks back-to-back-to-back.",
  "1431000005": "I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'd rather not hear\nany ghost stories. They're too scary for me.",
  "1430000000": "That cardinal Cherub or whatever was hella strong.",
  "1430001003": "Excellent! So, what's the story?",
  "1430001009": "That girl's a special kinda stupid.",
  "1432006030": "How sweet.",
  "1430003017": "You sound like a washed-out working stiff.",
  "1432006005": "The point of this is to learn more about you.\nAny par-for-the-course replies are prohibited.",
  "1432007015": "That was an instakill.",
  "1432004004": "Yeah, just because they say we aren't human\ndoesn't mean we're not us anymore.",
  "1432005008": "If you ask me, the present is what really matters.",
  "1432005006": "Same. Me and the folks weren't exactly joined at\nthe hip. Besides...",
  "1432000004": "Ami and I aren't geniuses capable of developing Eden.\nI can barely even navigate a computer.",
  "1432003002": "It's just, your actual name isn't exactly catchy.\n\"Propator, the First Deus ex Machina\" doesn't\nreally roll off the tongue, y'know?",
  "1432001000": "Ecclesia the Second has always been an ally of\nyours, whether you were Propator or Leben, yes?",
  "1432006014": "Not subtle enough, with how fast you caught on.",
  "1432000017": "Some resented her unnatural birth or considered\nher an impure human. Others felt threatened by\nher overwhelming intellect.",
  "1432000000": "What kind of person was Eve, anyway?",
  "1432006021": "That's not even a little unexpected.\nAnd it's way more than just a date.",
  "1432005003": "Me neither. We're not so close that I'd go outta my way\nto see 'em. Even when the virtual world's back in action,\nI still won't feel a lick of guilt.",
  "1432006031": "Just hearing this is making my blood sugar spike.",
  "1432002008": "Sorry to burst your weird, soul-stirred bubble,\nbut what good is money gonna do for you here?",
  "1432006019": "That was business as usual.",
  "1432002019": "N-No... You're not.",
  "1432002018": "Am I wrong?",
  "1432000016": "She was despised by the majority of people,\nincluding Adam--her gene donor and father.",
  "1432000021": "What an unpleasant story.",
  "1432000019": "That's why she wasn't credited with Eden's development,\nand why her personal data wasn't properly archived.",
  "1432004001": "It was a surprise, to be sure.",
  "1430000006": "A laborious task indeed.",
  "1432000001": "She was a high-school girl in a four-person household:\nher, her biological dad, her stepmom, and her younger\nhalf-sister.",
  "1432000008": "Even after all the ExP erosion, we never grew smarter,\nnor did we become more tech-savvy.",
  "1432007014": "I win.",
  "1440010001": "October means Halloween!\nAnd that calls for a costume party!",
  "1440011003": "In Japanese, 11/22 can be pronounced the same way as\n\"good couple\" by sounding each number out individually.",
  "1440011001": "Good Couple Day is in a few weeks, then!",
  "1440012001": "December? You know what that means!\nJingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way~!",
  "1440004001": "So it's April Fools' Day, then.",
  "1440005001": "May is when we celebrate Children's Day in Japan,\nwhich makes this the perfect time to dig deep into\neveryone's childhood stories!",
  "1440007001": "This is the month when we celebrate the Star Festival\nin Japan!",
  "1440008001": "August is when summer really gets into swing!\nIt's time for Obon and heart-pounding spooky stories!",
  "1440009001": "September would mean we've reached autumn in the\nvirtual world.",
  "1440001005": "Happy New Year! I wish you all the best in this life.",
  "1440005005": "...Moving on, then!",
  "1440004029": "...How was that?",
  "1440003007": "For starters, nonstop leaking outta half the holes on\nyour head is a crisis of epic proportions! Translate\nthat into machine terms, and it'd be a critical bug!",
  "1440003011": "But things are different now.\nI'd love it if we could all have a flower viewing.",
  "1440011026": "But my favorite part is the sense of trust and security\nthat we share, because I know that she'll be with me\nno matter what.",
  "1440012003": "...As I was saying!\nWhat present will you be asking Santa for?",
  "1440012012": "I'll take a phone booth that lets me explore any what-if\nscenario I can think of.",
  "1440004012": "It makes me want to pull the fibber's tongue out,\nthe way Lord Enma does.",
  "1440009009": "Mikoto isn't fond of exercise.\nIn fact, she was something of a social recluse.",
  "1440010009": "I'll stick with the reaper.",
  "1440012019": "...Yeah. Nothin' doing.",
  "1440005014": "This is a bit embarrassing, but you're welcome.",
  "1440011019": "Her serious side, for instance.\nOr her difficulty at expressing emotions.",
  "1440006016": "...but I'm sure any wedding would be beautiful\nif it's blessed with everyone's smiling faces.",
  "1440011006": "Don't question it, or you'll set her off like a bomb.",
  "1440003008": "That's...one way to put it?",
  "1440005021": "...Sure, but could you please not call me that?",
  "1440001004": "...Way to make it about yourself.",
  "1440007014": "C'mon. It's not like we can get sick when we're made\nof metal parts and wires.",
  "1440004008": "At that point, it's just straight up harrassment...",
  "1440008038": "You don't look afraid at all, though...",
  "1440002020": "...Ggh...",
  "1440002017": "Hmm... I don't think I can do that...",
  "1440008035": "Huh...? Not sure where this is going, but okay...",
  "1440006018": "What? Why me...?",
  "1440010018": "I-Is that how it went...?",
  "1440009026": "...Sure thing.",
  "1440008020": "Just thinkin' about it is making me queasy...",
  "1440008033": "The heck does that mean?",
  "1440004027": "*sigh* Could you be any more useless?\nStupid piece of trash...",
  "1440007023": "...I can't say I feel the same.",
  "1440008027": "Oh, honestly...",
  "1440003001": "Spring already...?\nFor once, I'm glad this world's not organic.",
  "1440007028": "I understand how you feel, Leben...",
  "1440012002": "Are you an advent calendar or something?\nIt's way too soon for Christmas spirit.",
  "1440006020": "That's not what I'm trying to say. It's just...do you\neven understand what it means to get married?!",
  "1440008012": "Energy resource depletion, maybe?\nOr...major power outages...?",
  "1440002025": "I'd be happy with anything if it came from you,\nbut...I think I've had my fill of things for now...",
  "1440003006": "People side-eye me after every sneeze, and my nose\ngets so stuffy that I can barely breathe, let alone sleep...",
  "1440005013": "The way you said that feels dirty somehow...",
  "1440010013": "An angel...",
  "1440011022": "Enough with the praise already. It's embarrassing...",
  "1440012014": "You didn't reel it in one bit, technologically speaking...",
  "1440010022": "...On second thought, I do remember.\nAnd I still think of you as an angel, too.",
  "1440002010": "One with a fiery, bloodcurdling message:\n\"Never celebrate Valentine's Day again!\"",
  "1440001013": "There's no \"used to\" about it,\nbecause the four of us are about to celebrate together!",
  "1440002006": "Your love is as smothering as always.",
  "1440012021": "Pack it in already.\nI'm not a gift you can give twice...",
  "1440001003": "New year, new Me-koto.",
  "1440001002": "Happy New Year.",
  "1440006014": "I can't really picture one, no.\nHow about you, Enoa?",
  "1440008010": "Not a bit. None of those even exist.",
  "1440005017": "...but I wasn't born in her virtual world.\nIt wouldn't mean the same coming from me.",
  "1440002012": "I guess I'll just keep it simple and go with flowers.\nWhat about you, Enoa?",
  "1440007025": "Even if I do get a next life, I want to live with\nyou guys for as long as possible in this one.",
  "1440005003": "Don't ask me, either. I've lost all my memories,\nboth of my childhood and my time as Propator.",
  "1440002016": "So I'd have exclusive rights, huh?",
  "1440002018": "Oh my. Whyever not?",
  "1440005015": "Oh? Aren't you going to give your thanks, Leben?",
  "1440012005": "Not in the least! Let your imagination whisk you away!",
  "1440003024": "Forget flower viewing.\nWe've already got ourselves a meteor shower.",
  "1440004010": "The same as any other day.\nI rather dislike sowing falsehoods.",
  "1440005008": "Hear me out. In this life, Enoa is basically our mom.\nCatch my drift?",
  "1440007021": "I mean, a thousand years plus is plenty.",
  "1440009003": "It's known for all sorts of things, but what does it mean\nto each of you?",
  "1440010016": "No. I was only remembering the first time I met Leben.",
  "1440007032": "No. I'm not going to make one at all.",
  "1440011010": "Urk. I can't say no to those eyes...\nWhat I like most about Enoa is--",
  "1440003015": "Yeah. Someday, for sure.",
  "1440003014": "Yes. That's why I want to see more of them with you\nsomeday, Leben.",
  "1440005012": "What she said. Plus, you're cute as heck with\na gold-star personality. All hail Mommy Enoa.",
  "1440004031": "Hear, hear! Cuteness is king!",
  "1440008016": "Blood?! You're pulling my leg, right?\nAren't you a huge splatter film fan?",
  "1440012020": "Well, I never! Rejecting me so readily...\nCan't you see you're all I want for Christmas?!",
  "1440009006": "Well, the only other thing I can think of is lazing around.",
  "1440001012": "Huh?",
  "1440005010": "Huh?",
  "1440007026": "Ooh! A rare glimpse of Leben's soft side!",
  "1440010003": "Anything overly terrifying is off-limits.",
  "1440001010": "It sounds like you both used to enjoy New Year's Day\nto the fullest.",
  "1440001008": "We never had a feast like that at our house on New Year's.",
  "1440009024": "I think all plants are beautiful, not just flowers, so yes,\nI would be very interested.",
  "1440001007": "Between mochi soup, sweet rolled omlettes, and mashed\nsweet potato with candied chestnuts, you're bound to get\na tummyache regardless.",
  "1440012004": "Are there any restrictions on my request?",
  "1440008022": "Don't call me the A-word.",
  "1440005006": "If Children's Day is a no-go, how 'bout we switch gears\nto Mother's Day instead?",
  "1440007011": "A fitting answer for the former First.",
  "1440006003": "Oh, Mikoto!\nI knew we had a telepathic connection!",
  "1440006001": "You know what that means.\nIt's time to talk about our ideal weddings.",
  "1440012009": "Then I'll take every other heavenly body in the solar system.",
  "1440010004": "Then how 'bout the Headless Horseman of Sleepy\nHollow? Haha, that'd be perfect for me, since I got\ndecapitated and everything.",
  "1440004007": "Wow. That's quite elaborate.",
  "1440002009": "Very splatter. And what movie is this from?",
  "1440007031": "My, what a bold statement!\nIs that your wish for the Star Festival, then?",
  "1440011021": "Everything about her gets a gold star.",
  "1440010002": "If I had to dress up, it'd be as a hyperrealistic creature.\nLike an extraterrestrial hunter with a preference for\ntropical climates.",
  "1440004016": "This is a once-in-a-year opportunity.\nWhy not tell a lie or two, just for the fun of it?",
  "1440008014": "Well, how about you, Mikoto?\nWhat are some of your fears?",
  "1440002007": "What do you plan to give for Valentine's Day, Mikoto?",
  "1440008024": "I'm curious, too. Even I don't know.",
  "1440005018": "That's right. It would be more accurate to consider\nyou my mother instead, since you're the First Deus\nex Machina.",
  "1440002024": "Really? Would getting snacks make you happy, Leben?",
  "1440009011": "Is it that bad?",
  "1440008002": "I see. Have fun, everyone.\nI'll be excusing myself.",
  "1440012010": "Good idea. We wouldn't be able to enjoy the Earth\nwithout the sun and the moon.",
  "1440008026": "Let's just say weak points are made to be exploited.",
  "1440011028": "That just leaves you, Mikoto.\nWhat do you like most about Ami?",
  "1440008017": "It's just hard to picture with how daring you are in Eden.",
  "1440009005": "You could say that about any time of year.",
  "1440007015": "On the contrary.\nMechanical bodies can be quite delicate.",
  "1440010000": "We just passed 12 AM of October 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440011000": "We just passed 12 AM of November 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440012000": "We just passed 12 AM of December 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440001000": "We just passed 12 AM of January 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440002000": "We just passed 12 AM of February 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440003000": "We just passed 12 AM of March 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440004000": "We just passed 12 AM of April 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440005000": "We just passed 12 AM of May 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440006000": "We just passed 12 AM of June 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440007000": "We just passed 12 AM of July 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440008000": "We just passed 12 AM of August 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440009000": "We just passed 12 AM of September 1st according\nto the former Coordinated Universal Time.",
  "1440007029": "So let's do all that we can to grant this wish and\nfind a way to live in this blissful world even longer.",
  "1440012008": "My reason is that I want to see the real Earth together with\nall of you.",
  "1440002019": "Because I promised Leben that we'd spend our lives\ntogether. My heart and body already belong to her.",
  "1440011012": "Don't put words in my mouth.\nI mean, yeah, she does look cute on the outside.",
  "1440005002": "There's not really much to tell.\nI was just a gloomy little film freak.",
  "1440011015": "In other words, her personality gets a gold star.",
  "1440001001": "In other words, Happy New Year, everyone.",
  "1440008037": "How terrifying. My cheeks are on fire.",
  "1440006013": "Your turn, Leben.\nDo you have an ideal wedding?",
  "1440007022": "You're right. And besides, once this life is over,\nI'll still be with Mikoto in the next, so there's no\nproblem.",
  "1440002003": "Correct! It's a time of showing your love for significant\nothers and family members in the form of heartfelt gifts!",
  "1440011007": "Alright, let's start with you, Leben!",
  "1440004017": "What, you mean right now?\nI can't just come up with something on the spot.",
  "1440007020": "But I'm sure the end will come. Because all things,\nincluding the world and the universe, will expire\neventually.",
  "1440008019": "But the real deal's too much for me to handle.\nI'd collapse whenever I got a shot or had my\nblood drawn.",
  "1440011013": "But what's more important is who she is on\nthe inside: a caring girl who loves her family.",
  "1440007002": "Which raises the question: if you could make\none wish come true, what would it be?",
  "1440004011": "Especially in regard to important promises,\nor equally important topics.",
  "1440010020": "M-Maybe a little?",
  "1440004003": "Do I look like a serial jokester to you?\n...Not that you're wrong.",
  "1440010015": "What's wrong? Feelin' shy?",
  "1440003002": "What do you mean?",
  "1440005007": "And how does that topic give us anything more to discuss\nthan the last?",
  "1440007019": "Good question. The life span of Idea Code is unknown,\nthough mine and the other Dei ex Machina's have been\nin operation for nearly a thousand years, at least.",
  "1440006009": "She's laying the groundwork, Mikoto.",
  "1440012011": "You guys just keep on upping the ante.\nGuess it's on me to reel things back a bit.",
  "1440004004": "What sort of pranks did you play?",
  "1440009008": "Nope. I'm a woman of culture.",
  "1440011027": "I see what you mean.",
  "1440002013": "I'm not sure what would be best,\nso I'll keep thinking about it.",
  "1440012006": "Then I choose the Earth, circa 2,000 years ago.",
  "1440008028": "In that case, my fear is Mikoto whispering sweet\nnothings into my ear!",
  "1440010011": "So Enoa as an angel and Leben as a little devil, then.",
  "1440008030": "I see. This is what they call \"briar patching.\"",
  "1440005009": "Ah, I see! You're saying we should show her our\ngratitude for Mother's Day!",
  "1440011002": "What's the story there?",
  "1440006012": "Yeah, yeah.",
  "1440008029": "Yeah, yeah.",
  "1440009016": "Yeah, yeah. How did you spend your falls, then, Ami?",
  "1440002011": "Yes, yes. Mikoto's cult classics aside,\nwhat sort of gift will you give, Leben?",
  "1440001015": "One worthy of a gold star.",
  "1440010023": "A gold star for you.",
  "1440003023": "That's an awful lot of stars to give out at once.",
  "1440006021": "Haha. Ami's not the only one laying the groundwork.",
  "1440008011": "Sounds about right. I never pegged you as much\nof a phasmophobe. Is there anything that DOES\nscare you?",
  "1440003019": "You could try not teasing us for a change.",
  "1440010012": "My, how apropos! Enoa is as angelic as can be,\nand devils are often depicted carrying spears.",
  "1440005022": "Hahaha. She says, oozing with satisfaction.\nWho's the dirty one now, eh?",
  "1440007009": "Let's leave Mikoto to her sulking.\nWhat would your wish be, Leben?",
  "1440008021": "She can be exceptionally adorable sometimes,\ncan't she?",
  "1440011023": "Heehee. Her shyness is part of her appeal, too.",
  "1440003016": "It's a promise.",
  "1440002021": "If you've already given her everything, then it's no\nwonder you're lost about what else you can offer.",
  "1440008039": "Heehee. But I really, truly am.\nNow stop overthinking it and scare me some more.",
  "1440010024": "Heehee. Perhaps Enoa would be a more fitting devil.",
  "1440011016": "Heehee. You don't have to stop there.",
  "1440002004": "I see. What are you going to give, Ami?",
  "1440003004": "Really. But if we're weighing pros and cons,\nisn't having no seasons worse than having\nallergies?",
  "1440007017": "Interesting. I figured they'd be a little more permanent.",
  "1440008003": "Come now, you don't have to make it so\nobvious that you don't want to be here.",
  "1440003018": "Eh, those lovebirds are crazy for each other.\nNothin' we can do about that.",
  "1440008031": "Briar what-ing?",
  "1440003022": "Every one of you deserves a gold star.",
  "1440004026": "Hm. Aggressive...",
  "1440003020": "It goes without saying that I love Leben...",
  "1440011018": "I love everything about her, of course.",
  "1440012013": "After all, the real world isn't enough. I want to explore\nparallel universes with superheroes and magic.",
  "1440009004": "Movies, movies, and more movies, for sure.",
  "1440006005": "Well, for starters, a pure-white dress is a must.\nApart from that...",
  "1440007008": "There, there, don't cry.",
  "1440011009": "How exciting.",
  "1440008032": "It's the same as me saying I'm afraid of you declaring\nyour love for me.",
  "1440009023": "Thank you for thinking about me, Leben.",
  "1440006015": "It's the same for me. There's nothing specific...",
  "1440008034": "You'll get it if you try scaring me.",
  "1440005020": "So thank you for making me happy, Mommy Leben.",
  "1440007024": "Huh?",
  "1440007005": "Ami, Leben's being mean to me.",
  "1440007012": "What is your wish, Ami?",
  "1440012015": "What're you gonna ask for, Ami?",
  "1440004009": "And you, Ami?\nHow did you spend April Fools' Day?",
  "1440011024": "What do you like about Mikoto, Ami?",
  "1440008023": "Do you have anything you're scared of, Ami?",
  "1440003021": "But I also love the two of you.\nAnd Zoe and Trinity as well.",
  "1440007004": "That's like something an elementary schooler would say.",
  "1440010008": "Get real! If we're talkin' western monsters with killer\nchopping arms, it's gotta be Jason!",
  "1440004032": "Kinda lacking in the aggression department, though.",
  "1440009013": "You never seem to have any trouble fighting in Eden.\nHow do you explain that?",
  "1440009021": "Enoa, Leben--what about you two?\nAny ideas on how you'd spend the season?",
  "1440010010": "As for Enoa and Leben, I think a couples costume\nwith contrasting themes would suit them nicely.",
  "1440003013": "You like flowers in general, Enoa.",
  "1440008004": "Why are you bad with scary things, Enoa?",
  "1440011017": "What do you like about Leben, Enoa?",
  "1440005016": "I'll never forget how grateful I am to Enoa...",
  "1440004005": "Well, I once coughed up fake blood and collapsed\non the floor. Got all of my classmates in on it, too.",
  "1440009018": "Potato croquettes, baked sweet potatoes, braised\npotatoes... 'Tis the season of toothsome tubers in\nevery which way!",
  "1440008005": "Nobody needs a reason to be afraid.\nI'm scared because I'm scared.",
  "1440004021": "How very robotic.",
  "1440003012": "What a pleasant thought.\nRoses are nice, but I enjoy cherry blossoms, too.",
  "1440006007": "We'll spare no effort with the venue and attire.\nI can handle it in virtual space, or ask Zoe for\nhelp if we opt for the real world.",
  "1440004028": "A wimp like you can't do crud, so don't even\nbother trying. Just let me handle it, alright?",
  "1440003003": "Mikoto is rather susceptible to hay fever.",
  "1440010006": "If Mikoto goes as the Dullahan, then I wonder\nwhat I should be as the other half of the pair...",
  "1440004002": "This seems like your kind of holiday, Mikoto.",
  "1440012018": "Mikoto's rights belong to Mikoto. So it's up to her.",
  "1440003009": "Mikoto's memories of springtime may be negative,\nbut what about you, Ami?",
  "1440009020": "Mont Blancs ARE delectable, but I prefer something\nI can hold and eat in one hand without any table\nmanners to mind.",
  "1440002014": "What's best is to hit her with a straight shot of love!",
  "1440011014": "She looked past my labels and accepted me for who\nI really, truly am.",
  "1440006017": "Leben. You and Enoa need to have a beautiful\nwedding of your own--no ifs, ands or buts!",
  "1440010017": "Calling me an angel was the very first thing she did.",
  "1440001014": "You guys are our family now, after all.",
  "1440006019": "You don't want to, Leben?",
  "1440004025": "If you want to try things out Leben-style, a few\nquips on the aggressive side might be interesting!",
  "1440005011": "You brought this family together and supported us\nat every step. You're an angel, Enoa!",
  "1440002015": "Why not give your heart and body to Leben,\nthe way I'm giving mine to Mikoto?",
  "1440004015": "But enough about me.\nWhat about you, Enoa? Leben?",
  "1440003017": "The gall of you two, hijacking my talking point for your\nsweet little nothings.",
  "1440012016": "My wish is simple compared to all of yours!\nWhat I'd really like to ask Santa for...is Mikoto!",
  "1440003010": "I wasn't overly fond of it, either. Between starting and\ngraduating from school, it was a hectic season all\naround.",
  "1440008006": "You sound like Vida.",
  "1440007030": "I don't want the laws of nature to deny us the lives\nwe deserve.",
  "1440004020": "I love humans. Humans are the best.\nTh-They get a gold star for being so amazing!\n...Like that?",
  "1440005019": "The joy I have now only exists because you gave me\na heart, acknowledged it, and accepted me.",
  "1440012017": "That's just as unrealistic, ethically speaking.",
  "1440008007": "What kinds of things frighten you in particular?",
  "1440004014": "I'm only fooling.",
  "1440012007": "One answer in and already we're at a planetary scale.",
  "1440011008": "I have to go first?!",
  "1440002022": "There is no room for creativity.",
  "1440004030": "Absolutely adorable.",
  "1440007003": "What else? An unlimited supply of wishes.",
  "1440007027": "Stop overreacting.",
  "1440006010": "Here's hoping it stops there.",
  "1440007006": "Oh, don't mind her, Mikoto.\nYour childishness is one of your charms!",
  "1440002002": "Was that the day when you traditionally gave presents\nto a special someone?",
  "1440008036": "I love you, Enoa.",
  "1440010014": "You don't like it? I think it's a good match.",
  "1440006011": "It'll be the foundation of an opulent palace once\nI'm through!",
  "1440011004": "Why don't we all pair up and say what we like\nabout each other for the sake of marital bliss?",
  "1440011005": "\"Marital\"?",
  "1440008025": "You look a smidge too excited. Just what are you\nplanning to do when you find out?",
  "1440004006": "And this other time, I taped over TV recordings at home\nso that it looked like a death game host was talking right\nat you.",
